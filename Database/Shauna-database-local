In other words, these slurpers aren’t able to do everything we want them to do at this time. <br /><br />Of course, you can still cut and paste your entries and comments, but we know that’s unacceptable and a major drag. <br /><br />I have it on good authority that the TypePad slurper will be up and running again with our next release. Blogger and WordPress.com will follow. <br /><br />That’s it for the update. I’m truly sorry I don’t have more news. I will definitely post more news when we have it. Until then, thanks very much for your patience.', 0, '1', '', '', 0, 0),

I think that makes since.  I also loved the walks home listening to them talk about their day without having to concentrate on driving.  But one of the biggest benefits to walking is that the parents mingle and get to know each other.  That doesn''t happen in car line.<br /><br />God will show you the way!

With it will come full theme compatibility with almost all existing WordPress themes, making it easier than ever to get your community up and running quickly. For those of you looking for a complete changelog, check out <a href="http://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&group=resolution&milestone=1.7">the 1.7 milestone in trac</a>.</p>\n<p>From now until 1.7 is released, we will be periodically merging our ongoing development into the WordPress.org plugin repository. If you&#8217;re just starting your first BuddyPress site, we encourage you to start with the 1.7 beta rather than 1.6.4, so that you&#8217;re familiar with what&#8217;s coming rather than what&#8217;s passed.</p>\n<p>Now&#8217;s the time to <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Reporting_Bugs">report some feedback</a> and let us know if you find anything unexpected happening. We are on course to release BuddyPress 1.7 in the first half of March.</p>\n<p>If you think you found a bug, please report it on the <a href="http://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org">BuddyPress Core Trac</a>.

This vulnerability, which could potentially be used to expose information and compromise a site, affects all previous WordPress versions. This was fixed by the WordPress security team.

The WordPress community is stronger than ever, and some of the accomplishments of the past year are definitely worth remembering.</p>\n<h4>Software Releases</h4>\n<p>We had two major releases of the WordPress web application with versions <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/06/green/">3.4</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/12/elvin/">3.5</a>, as well as 5 security releases during 2012. 3.4 included the theme customizer, while 3.5 became the long awaited &#8220;media release&#8221; featuring a new uploader and gallery management tool. 3.5 contained code contributions from more people than ever, and we hope to continue growing the contributor ranks in the year ahead. We currently have native apps on 6 mobile platforms &#8212; <a href="http://ios.wordpress.org/">iOS</a>, <a href="http://android.wordpress.org/">Android</a>, <a href="http://blackberry.wordpress.org/">Blackberry</a>, <a href="http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/">Windows Phone</a>, <a href="http://nokia.wordpress.org/">Nokia</a>, and <a href="http://webos.wordpress.org/">WebOS</a> &#8212; and saw several updates there as well.</p>\n<h4>Plugin Directory</h4>\n<p>A number of improvements were made to the Plugin Directory in 2012. More cosmetic  updates, like the introduction of branded plugin page headers, make it a nicer browsing experience, while functional changes like better-integrated support forums, plugin reviews, and a favorites system made the plugin directory even more useful as a resource.</p>\n<h4>The &#8220;Make&#8221; Network and Team Reps</h4>\n<p>2012 was the year that saw the creation of <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/">Make.wordpress.org</a>, a network of sites for the teams of contributors responsible for the different areas of the WordPress project. Now anyone can follow along and get involved with the teams that work on <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/">core</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/themes/">theme review</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/support/">forum support</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/">documentation</a>, and more. In 2013 we&#8217;ll work to improve these sites to make it easier to become a contributor. Each team also now has elected Team Reps, a new role that has already led to more cross-team communication. Team reps post each week to the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/updates/">Updates blog</a> so that the other reps can keep up with what&#8217;s going on in other teams.</p>\n<h4>WordPress Community Summit</h4>\n<p>At the end of October, about 100 of the most influential and respected members of the WordPress community attended an inaugural <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/summit">summit</a> to discuss where we all stand, and to figure out where we go next with WordPress. A &#8220;conference of conversations,&#8221; this unconference made everyone an active participant, and while not every issue brought to the table was solved by the end of the event, the right questions were being asked.</p>\n<h4>Meetup.com</h4>\n<p>The WordPress Foundation now has a central account with Meetup.com. We&#8217;ve brought in a couple dozen existing meetup groups as a pilot to test the system, and are in the process of working with more existing meetups (as well as new ones) to join us so that local organizers won&#8217;t have to pay organizer dues and can get more support from the WordPress project.</p>\n<h4>Internet Blackout Day</h4>\n<p>We participated in the protest against SOPA/PIPA, Internet Blackout Day, on January 18. Though we usually stay out of politics, this campaign was important, and we not only participated in the blackout on WordPress.org, we encouraged our users to do so as well, and recommended plugins to provide blackout functionality. It was deemed the <a href="http://sopastrike.com/numbers/">largest online protest in history</a>.</p>\n<h4>WordCamps</h4>\n<p>And finally, it wouldn&#8217;t be a recap without counting up the <a href="http://wordcamp.org">WordCamps</a>! There were 67 WordCamps around the world in 2012, bringing together WordPress users, developers, and fans. If you didn&#8217;t make it to a WordCamp this year, maybe it can be one of your new year resolutions: <a href="http://central.wordcamp.org/schedule/">check the schedule</a> to find one near you!</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/01/2012-a-look-back/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:42:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:25:"WordPress 3.5 “Elvin”";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:40:"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/12/elvin/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:49:"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/12/elvin/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:54:23 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2517";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:363:"It&#8217;s the most wonderful time of the year: a new WordPress release is available and chock-full of goodies to delight bloggers and developers alike.

Media has long been a friction point and we&#8217;ve listened hard and given a lot of thought into crafting this new system. 3.5 includes a new default theme, Twenty Twelve, which has a very clean mobile-first responsive design and works fantastic as a base for a CMS site. Finally we&#8217;ve spent a lot of time refreshing the styles of the dashboard, updating everything to be Retina-ready with beautiful high resolution graphics, a new color picker, and streamlining a couple of fewer-used sections of the admin.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a quick video overview of everything you can share with your friends:</p>\n<div id="v-jQDfEbzZ-1" class="video-player"><embed id="v-jQDfEbzZ-1-video" src="http://s0.videopress.com/player.swf?v=1.03&amp;guid=jQDfEbzZ&amp;isDynamicSeeking=true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="692" height="388" title="Introducing WordPress 3.5" wmode="direct" seamlesstabbing="true" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" overstretch="true"></embed></div>\n<h3>For Developers</h3>\n<p>You can now put your (or anyone&#8217;s) WordPress.org username on the plugins page and see your favorite tagged ones, to make it easy to install them again when setting up a new site. There&#8217;s a new Tumblr importer. New installs no longer show the links manager. Finally for multisite developers <code>switch_to_blog()</code> is way faster and you can now install MS in a sub-directory. The <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore</a> and <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> JavaScript libraries are now available. <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.5">The Codex has a pretty good summary of the developer features above and beyond this</a>, and you can always <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/3.5">grab a warm beverage and explore Trac directly</a>.</p>\n<h3>Percussion Section</h3>\n<p>Behind every great release is great contributors. 3.5 had more people involved than any release before it:</p>\n<p><a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/aaroncampbell">Aaron D.

And the all-HiDPI (retina) dashboard.</li>\n<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Keyboard navigation and screen reader support have both been improved.</li>\n<li><strong>Plugins: </strong>You can browse and install plugins you&#8217;ve marked as favorites on WordPress.org, directly from your dashboard.</li>\n<li><strong>Mobile: </strong>It&#8217;ll be easier to link up your WordPress install with <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/mobile/">our mobile apps</a>, as XML-RPC is now enabled by default.</li>\n<li><strong>Links: </strong>We&#8217;ve hidden the Link Manager for new installs. (Don&#8217;t worry, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/link-manager/">there&#8217;s a plugin for that</a>.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Developers: </strong>We love you. We do. And one of the things we strive to do with every release is be compatible with all existing plugins and themes. To make sure we don&#8217;t break anything, we need your help. <strong>Please, please test your plugins and themes against 3.5.</strong> If something isn&#8217;t quite right, please let us know. (Chances are, it wasn&#8217;t intentional.) And despite all of the changes to media, we&#8217;re still aiming to be backwards compatible with plugins that make changes to the existing media library. It&#8217;s a tall task, and it means we need your help.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s some more things we think developers will enjoy (and should test their plugins and themes against):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>External libraries updated:</strong> TinyMCE  <del>3.5.6</del> 3.5.7. SimplePie <del>1.3</del> 1.3.1. jQuery <del>1.8.2</del> 1.8.3. jQuery UI <del>1.9 (and it&#8217;s not even released yet)</del> 1.9.2. We&#8217;ve also added Backbone 0.9.2 and Underscore <del>1.3.3</del> 1.4.2, and you can use protocol-relative links when enqueueing scripts and styles. (<a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16560">#16560</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>WP Query:</strong> You can now ask to receive posts in the order specified by <code>post__in</code>. (<a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13729">#13729</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>XML-RPC:</strong> New user management, profile editing, and post revision methods.

Also: You can now use multisite in a subdirectory, and uploaded files no longer go through ms-files (for new installs).

(<a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21812">#21812</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>Posts API: </strong>Major performance improvements when working with hierarchies of pages and post ancestors. Also, you can now &#8220;turn on&#8221; native custom columns for taxonomies on edit post screens.

Thank you sweet Meagan. Click <a href="http://www.aspoonfulofjenkins.blogspot.com/">here</a> for her personal blog.]</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>I''ve <a href="http://www.aspoonfulofjenkins.blogspot.com/2010/10/tassle-expectation.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">mentioned</a> my dear friends, <a href="http://www.localhost:8888/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Ben and Shauna Pilgreen</span></a>, on this blog before. Since junior high, they have been huge parts of my life as Ben was my youth minister and Shauna the most incredible life-sharing youth minister''s wife, mentor, and present day friend that I could ask for. When they lived in Tuscaloosa while Ben was a youth minister at Calvary, they almost had me convinced to attend the University of Alabama. <i>That</i> is how much I love them.</span></div><div></div><div><span>Shauna has completed a dream by co-authoring a book with Courtney Bullard [who I have not yet had the pleasure of meeting] entitled The Same Page: Living Your Happily Ever After which is now available for purchase! It is an absolute honor to be asked to participate in their blog tour - quite possibly the most exciting thing I''ve ever done with this blog of ours!</span></div><span>I didn''t expect that being able to tangibly hold a piece of my Shauna''s wisdom would be such an emotional experience. Knowing her, I can vouch for the fact that her loving and sensitive spirit leap from the pages beginning with acknowledgments and a forward. I will cherish this as we are soon to be living on completely opposite coasts!</span><br><div></div><div><span>The story of The Same Page is a medieval fairytale with lessons much more important and real than "everyone gets a good-looking'' prince in the end." You walk through a couple of days with both a mother and a daughter - Adela and Ysabel - on both sides of the story. I mean this literally - you read one story, flip the book over and read the other side. I''m in love with this creative, thought-provoking and dimension-adding publishing style. Though it is a quick read, it seemed as though I felt every cobblestone underfoot as both characters emotionally unearth the reasons behind Ysabel''s feelings of being misunderstood and search for identity along with Adela''s loving concern for her daughter and feelings of forgotten dreams. No matter what your current role is in life - mother, daughter, friend - I have no doubt that you will relate to one or both of these characters.</span></div><div><span>Among many, one of the struggles that stood out to me that is highlighted in this book is comparison and dislike of who one is. On both sides of the story, you experience several minutes of their stream of consciousness which is laden with hatred for what they look like, who they have become and what their lives have turned out to be. What is incredibly important to know about this book is that these moments stand in stark contrast with King El-Roi''s words which are taken directly from Holy scripture. He is there, just as He has the power to in our own lives, reminding the women that they are seen, that they are loved, that they are of great worth.</span></div><div><span>I hope that you will join Adela and Ysabel on their journey of reconciliation all the while discovering their true happily ever after. I know that I, after reading this book, will reflect their learned efforts of listening rather than just hearing. I will see this ability as a privilege for those deep relationships that the Lord has entrusted me with. And I will be reminded that my God is a God who sees and who knows my happily ever after.</span></div><div><span>Be sure to visit The Same Page Book <a href="http://www.thesamepagebook.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span>website</span></a>.

I loved getting lost in the storyline of Adela & Ysebel, the mother and daughter who each tell the story from their own point of view. It was my go-to book for a mental break when I needed to check out of my reality for a few minutes and jump into someone else''s.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Without giving away too much, this is a story of a mother and daughter who are struggling to understand each other. Reading the story from both people''s perspectives is really helpful in considering what the other person must be feeling or thinking. It exposes the "why" behind the outward behavior.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>As moms, we can get so focused on the external behavior that we often miss the heart of our child. We forget to probe deeper to understand more fully what''s motivating the behavior, and in the process can deeply wound our kids and teach them to retreat inside themselves instead of coming to us to talk through what''s going on in their hearts.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>This book gave me a renewed commitment to listen to heart of my kids.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>The other key lesson that I learned from this book was in regards to pursuing my own dreams. Motherhood requires a lot of self-sacrifice and service to others. Most days, my whole life revolves around meeting other people''s needs. And at the end of the day, no one is giving me high-fives for folding the laundry or doing back flips because I scrubbed a couple toilets or sending me a bonus check for preparing and cleaning up from three meals that day. And you know what? I''m okay with that. I''m learning to embrace my role as a mom and (most days) I''m incredibly grateful for the privilege of getting to stay home with my kiddos.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>But in the midst of getting life accomplished, it''s easy to lose yourself.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>It''s so easy to invest all of my energy and time into helping my husband and children accomplish their goals that I forget that once upon a time I had goals of my own. Goals. Dreams. An identity apart from anyone else.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>As a mom, it''s often easier just to shelf our own goals because it seems like a bad time to pursue them. And we can tell ourselves that we''re honoring God by dying to ourselves and putting other people''s goals and interests above our own. But really what we''re doing is just dying. A piece of us (a beautiful piece that God uniquely created in us) lies dormant, but it was meant to thrive.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>This book reminded me that I need to rummage through the closets in my heart where I stored some goals for a more convenient time, dust off the cobwebs, and start to dream again.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>The reality is that I do my family a huge a favor when I am fully alive. I give my kids a gift by showing them what it looks like to fully embrace the dreams God puts in our hearts. My family does not need a domestic servant. They need a mom who loves life, loves them, and is living her happily ever after.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>That is what "The Same Page" stirred up in my heart.

Memorizing Scripture can start very young and is powerful in the home and in our lives.

It''s a small task that makes a big change. </span></div><div><span>Our children are never too young to begin speaking to them about their character development. When we pray together, we ask each other, "what is something that you need God to help you with in your heart?" "what is something you notice that you are getting better at in your heart?" We pray for and rejoice in these character journeys.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>How about you and yours? Where are you growing?

It was a moment I will never forget as 100 people from the Epic community gathered at Ben and Lindsey''s apartment pool to witness our church''s first baptism. 3 young ladies made their faith public as they were baptized before their parents, family, and friends. I loved that as we applauded, by-standers joined in the clapping. I love that we surrounded a pool and gave our undivided attention to those around us and those being baptized. I love that God gave us the most sunny day for the occasion. I love that we <i>get</i> to improvise; that we <i>get</i> to think unconventionally. I love that our church community responds with enthusiasm. <div>It wasn''t just an evening for baptism, but of fellowship. With the help of our small groups, Uche, one of our volunteers, organized the food, cooking, and greeting. She exemplified a servant on so many levels. She complimented each person that was helping her out. </div><div>As a mom, I was fulfilled to see the kids form community outside of their usual interaction at church. I took a minute to look around the tables, to look at those gathered at the grill and those soaking in the last bit of sun at the pool. Everyone engaged in conversation. Laughter. Learning new names. Asian. African. Preschooler. Art student. Single mom. Aging parents. A clump of girls exchanging phone numbers and email addresses as they discover community together for the first time. Parents chatting with other parents - with one eye on the kids. Young professionals already making the next weekend plans together. </div><div><br></div><div>What a display.

After all, that’s why pitchers were created. Well, actually they were first created to be filled then spilled of their contents. And, what is stored within a pitcher is always what is revealed when poured. </span></span></span></p> <p><span><span><span>For example, if our lives are filled with activity, they will overflow with busyness. However, if our lives are filled with Jesus and His Word, they have the potential to teem with purpose. </span></span></span></p> <p><span><span><span>Although God’s primary intention in creating women is for them to fulfill His purposes, this is sometimes forgotten amid the daily tasks of being a wife and mom. Even though we desire our lives to be meaningful, they sometimes end up appearing to be merely motion-filled. In other words, we look at the achievements that pour from our daily lives but have difficulty recognizing God’s purpose in them. </span></span></span></p> <p><span><span><span>If we desire to live purposefully for Jesus, we will need to begin considering what we use to fill our lives. Without the proper “filling,” the “spilling” will be less than God’s best.  </span></span></span><span><span><span> </span></span></span></p> <p><span><span><span>Colossians 3:16a tells us: </span></span><span><span>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom,. . .</span></span><span><span> </span></span></span></p> <p><span><span><span>God so desires for us to be filled with His Word, its truth continually permeating our thoughts, words, and actions. Then, as we pour our lives into others, the character and truth of Jesus will be revealed (fulfilling His eternal purpose for us.)  </span></span></span></p> <p><span><span><span>Since God’s Word can be practically applied in daily living, we should become intentional about being filled with and pouring forth its principles</span></span></span><span><span>. So, what might these practices look like in the life of an active wife and mom?</span></span></p> <p><span><span><span>To begin with, we need to remember that filling takes precedence over pouring! So, it’s wise to prepare in advance Scripture verses</span></span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span><span>to focus on throughout each day. Since opportunities to meditate on truth may be brief, plan to intentionally use any available time rather than fill it with other activity.</span></span></span></p> <p><span><span><span>As you invest your time in being filled with truth, it is encouraging to know that God’s Word is the only thing that comes with a guarantee of eternal purpose (Isaiah 55:11). As a result, when you choose to pour truth into the lives of others, you are investing in eternity rather than in the temporal. </span></span></span></p> <p><span><span><span>Some practical ways to pour truth into every day life might be: As you swap creative recipes and craft ideas with fellow moms, choose to develop and share unique ways to encourage each other’s family members with truth. As you communicate to your husband all that occurred throughout the day, point to evidence of specific things God is accomplishing in your life. When you send a card to encourage a friend, include written promises of God. While the play group is sharing all the plans they have for their children’s future, convey what God has planned for all those who love Him. Practice making the Lord the focus of your texts and tweets. When instructing your child, explain the purpose behind each request by linking the instruction with a biblical principle. </span></span></span></p> <p><span><span><span>As you experience the effect truth has on the lives of those you pour into, you will have an increasing desire to be filled with God’s Word. </span></span></span></p><div><span><span><br></span></span></div></span><p></p><p><span><span><span>So how about you? What are some practical ways you pour out truth to your family or into conversations around you? </span></span></span></p></div><div><p><span><span> </span></span></p></div><div><p><span><span>I invite you to leave a comment to the question.

I, the keeper of the chart, put a star for each chore completed. On Saturday, we tally up the stars. One star equals one dime. </div><div><div><br></div><div>The star chart hangs in our laundry room just above our trash can. If the star chart is not in a prominent place, it gets forgotten.

[<i>Going Public</i>]</div><div>Elijah is enjoying and thriving in first grade this year in the public school system in SF. Sam just turned 5 and Asher just turned 3 and are with me at home. I do my best to do preschool activities 3 days a week with them. Here''s just a few of the things we do. Nothing elaborate. Nothing that requires an education degree. And all accomplished in about 30 minutes.</div><div><br></div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TSevVmgkd7I/AAAAAAAACI4/lzI0YUOTVbY/s1600/DSC03140.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TSevVmgkd7I/AAAAAAAACI4/lzI0YUOTVbY/s320/DSC03140.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><div>These books I''ve picked up at Borders and Barnes & Noble. They have a collection of them and and are simple tear out pages that are basic in skills such as tracing letters and progress at a slow pace through the book. Sam does one sheet per day on his own and I check over it. He gets a sticker for completing the worksheet. While Sam is working on this worksheet, I do worksheets with Asher from a simple preschool workbook. It teaches shapes, colors, size, and introduces letters. Asher usually only has the attention to do this one worksheet and then I give him either:</div><div>a blank notebook where he can doodle</div><div>paper and a pair of kid scissors that he practice cutting</div><div>or he plays with his trains</div><div>While Asher is doing his independent thing, I do the following book with Sam.</div><div><br></div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TSevVBLhX6I/AAAAAAAACIo/W-flUVXYsNA/s1600/DSC03142.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TSevVBLhX6I/AAAAAAAACIo/W-flUVXYsNA/s320/DSC03142.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><div>This a great book!!! It requires commitment. It literally is 100 lessons that you work through with your child. It literally tells you as the parent what to say in red print and what to do in black print. It teaches sounds. Usually you teach one sound on one lesson and then review it on the next lesson or two. The lesson takes us about 15 minutes. It''s broken down into several exercises which keeps Sam''s attention. The last exercise per lesson has the child write two of the letters they have been learning. Because this book takes the whole school year to complete and requires commitment and determination from Sam, I had Sam think of a toy that he wants from the toy store. We wrote that item on the back page of the book and he knows when he accomplishes the book, he is rewarded with this toy. </div><div><br></div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TSevUscvn8I/AAAAAAAACIg/SgdYc6yhE9w/s1600/DSC03143.JPG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TSevUscvn8I/AAAAAAAACIg/SgdYc6yhE9w/s320/DSC03143.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><div>I got these wipe off boards in the Target $1 bin at the beginning of the school year in August. I write the letter twice and have Sam write each letter 10 times. Then for fun I ask him to circle his favorite one that he wrote. It challenges him to do well. </div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><span><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TSevVSeKuiI/AAAAAAAACIw/ecjCfip4NjE/s320/DSC03141.JPG" border="0" alt=""></span></div><div>I usually do ''school'' after breakfast and after I''ve started the dishwasher or the washer/dryer. When the workbooks are completed, I set out another learning tool for the boys to do while I get ready for the day. This activity has to keep them engaged, but encourages me to come back to them and see what they''ve done.</div><div><br></div><div>These geo-shapes above are great for the imagination. Sometimes I give them a theme like nature or outer space for them to work towards. They see what they can build. Other times I start a pattern for them and they try to complete it.</div><div><br></div><div>We recycle, but before I take it to the bin, I let the kids have at it! I pull the items out onto the floor. Egg cartons, cardboard boxes, and toilet paper rolls can spark a child''s creativity. They stack and build forts and towers. When I''m around, I let them cut and tape. </div><div><br></div><div>I''ve learned that if you set out toys/activities occasionally, they will not be as easily bored as if you just told them to go and play. So sometimes I set out puzzles or audio books. </div><div><br></div><div>A few other goals I have during my days with the kids at home:</div><div><br></div><div>I try to read at least one book to each child each day. Elijah reads to me.</div><div><br></div><div>I try and do one outing a week with the kids that is for them. Sometimes it is tempting to count 10 minutes on the toy aisles at Target as their outing! Story time or craft time at the library is an easy and convenient one for us. Choosing a park in the city is a favorite of theirs. Setting up a playdate requires scheduling on my part and the part of another family, but is a win-win. We are blessed to live in a city that offers free days at museums and brings in lots of talented people and exhibits. </div><div><br></div><div>And finally, when we are all back together for the day, we ask the boys to share their high/low. The high is their favorite part of their day and the low is just the opposite. It''s a quick way to hear about their day and lots of times it gives us insight into their friendships and joys and struggles. We always turn these conversations into celebrations or stop and pray for their hurts and others. </div><div><br></div><div>This is how we do school in this season for our family. It works. It will change as Sam goes to school in the fall and as our boys become more involved in extra-curricular activities.

When my constant thinking turns to worry, I am saying that I don''t trust God enough.So I''m constantly giving this back to God. </div><div>With this being said, I believe this to be our Year of Traditions. Traditions take root. They repeat themselves. They are celebrations. </div><div>Since we have had children, I have anticipated traditions being a part of our family, but I have shied away from beginning any or keeping any as we have often been in transition.</div><div>Well, forget that! Moves happen in ministry, especially when you rent. </div><div>Whether we are in our current home in one year or not, here are a few traditions the Pilgreens will joyfully observe in 2011!</div><div><br></div><div><b>Salvation Day</b></div><div>January 7.2007, March 23.1985, and April 25.1985 are the days that Elijah, myself, and Ben gave our lives to Jesus.

I took some character traits and lessons that we want to be a part of our family and we did some fun games and activities for a few days.</div><div><br></div><div>This is my ''just getting started'' list. </div><div><br></div><div>We have started our year off well with a week''s worth of all new recipes that are healthy and delicious...so far.

During our family time at night, we let each of the boys draw a card out of the tin. We talk about that family and how we know them and then the boys pray for that family''s 2011.

Instead we can experience Johnny''s Pizza, family trip to Narnia: Voyage of the Dawn Treader, the Georgia Aquarium, and several trips to Chick-fil-a!</span></div><div><span>This Christmas season was all the more sweeter now that we live on the west coast and family visits are rare. It was a blessing to fly east and spend 2 weeks visiting family and friends. Ben and I discussed that our gift this season was the priceless gift of <i>time</i>. Our God, who loves to give good gifts to His children (James 1:17) blessed us abundantly with <i>time</i>. </span></div><div><span>Just the 5 of us spent countless hours in a rental car traveling from Atlanta to Albany, GA to Americus to Tuscaloosa to Calhoun, LA to Ruston to Monroe to Gainesville, GA and back to Atlanta. </span></div><div><span>so without going into every detail...</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div>tick tock. tick tock. </div><div>here''s how we spent our hours on the clock.</div><div>for every hour of time awake</div><div>we lavished in the conversations</div><div>and laughs for ole'' times sake.</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TR4MgEKwpOI/AAAAAAAACG4/HB7koVocC_M/s1600/DSC02966.JPG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TR4MgEKwpOI/AAAAAAAACG4/HB7koVocC_M/s320/DSC02966.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><div>12 o''clock: Paths do cross again! My childhood neighbor and friend, Christy, had our family over for cupcakes for Asher''s 3rd birthday while in Albany, GA. We caught up on Camilla news and introduced our families to one another. It was good to see them in person after following her blog for several years. </div><div><br></div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TR4MfmTdEyI/AAAAAAAACGw/cCFZjP0EYQc/s1600/DSC02968.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TR4MfmTdEyI/AAAAAAAACGw/cCFZjP0EYQc/s320/DSC02968.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></div><div>1 o''clock: Elizabeth and I were 1996 graduates of Westwood in Camilla. Her family now attends Sherwood and serves in the college/career ministry. Ben and I got to spend some time sharing our story with a small group of leaders in that area on Sunday afternoon. We also go to catch up on life and introduce our families to each other. We are certain we will see them soon in San Francisco! </div><div><br></div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TR4MhLjG3DI/AAAAAAAACHQ/fE-HF4-WQF8/s1600/DSC02997.JPG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TR4MhLjG3DI/AAAAAAAACHQ/fE-HF4-WQF8/s320/DSC02997.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><div>2 o''clock: God gave me 2 sisters, but He has blessed me with 3 sisters through Ben''s side of the family. It''s amazing how we can pick up where we left off - and that''s with 8 kids running around from ages 8 and under! We talk cooking, exercise, recipes, and craft ideas. We also share about life where we live and what God is teaching us.</div><div><br></div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TR4Mg3mk2II/AAAAAAAACHI/2Ob6yvVpkRU/s1600/DSC02988.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TR4Mg3mk2II/AAAAAAAACHI/2Ob6yvVpkRU/s320/DSC02988.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><div>3 o''clock: If there''s a father-son relationship to model, it''s this one. Ben treasures every second he gets with his dad. Though they talk often on the phone, nothing compares with face to face time. Whether it''s time outside with the ball and glove or pulling up a chair in the midst of a full house, they find time to talk sports, laugh about memories, and challenge one another. </div><div><br></div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TR4MgjQdQnI/AAAAAAAACHA/24FBhqfvGIs/s1600/DSC02978.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TR4MgjQdQnI/AAAAAAAACHA/24FBhqfvGIs/s320/DSC02978.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><div>4 o''clock: Ben, his brother-in-law Zach, his brother Lee, and his brother-in-law Walter. We count our blessings for our family and don''t take for granted the fact that we actually love each other and get along! These guys model godly husbands and are raising their families in such an honorable way. </div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TR4QHuPcszI/AAAAAAAACHo/ov4VmjZOhl8/s1600/DSC03072.JPG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TR4QHuPcszI/AAAAAAAACHo/ov4VmjZOhl8/s320/DSC03072.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><div>5 o''clock: There''s just one other on the Malcom side and that''s 16 month old Ella Reese. She and Sam took to each other quickly. Her gibberish is something I could listen to all day. She and Asher cooked in her little kitchen and she always had a small toiletry item in her hand. </div><div><br></div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TR4QHQEy8EI/AAAAAAAACHg/JhTM2WvgsTI/s1600/IMG_2715.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TR4QHQEy8EI/AAAAAAAACHg/JhTM2WvgsTI/s320/IMG_2715.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></div><div><div>6 o''clock: Natalie, my sister, and Michael, my cousin shared with us about their churches they are plugged into and the friendships in their communities and in their jobs. My aunt Debbie and I talked much about playing into our kid''s strengths by knowing how they think...whether they are left brained or right brained. Then we found ourselves laughing as we watched left brained Elijah interact with right brain Sam!</div><div><br></div><div><span><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TR_O4HoqM-I/AAAAAAAACIY/NkjNy5OpGU8/s320/IMG_0814.jpg" border="0" alt=""></span></div><div>7 o''clock: This is Sweet Nanny. We became dear friends in our time in Tuscaloosa as we attended Bible Study together. She and I continue to writer letters to one another and call each other. I know she prays for our family and for Epic Church. I got the joy of meeting her for coffee and bagels on her 64th wedding anniversary - December 22. She lives such a legacy of faith, prayer, and giving. Time with Sweet Nanny is absolutely precious.</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TR_OkNp8EiI/AAAAAAAACIQ/VeCdim6yPUQ/s1600/IMG_0813.JPG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TR_OkNp8EiI/AAAAAAAACIQ/VeCdim6yPUQ/s320/IMG_0813.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a>8 o''clock: Roll Tide! We stayed a night in Tuscaloosa on our drive out to Louisiana. Alan and Lauren Henderson were gracious to host us in their new home. We met up with several former college students for dinner and an Alabama basketball game. Our friend, Kimberlee, who works for Alabama Athletics brought Big Al to us in the stands for a personal high-5!</div><div><br><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TR_OjxmXeaI/AAAAAAAACII/x0wS46WzAlY/s1600/IMG_0807.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TR_OjxmXeaI/AAAAAAAACII/x0wS46WzAlY/s320/IMG_0807.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></div><div>9 o''clock: Moses was adopted into our family when mom and dad discovered empty nest a few years ago. Though I''m not a dog lover, I appreciate the companionship he brings to mom and dad...though he might bring more companionship to his kennel friends with all the traveling they do! Nonetheless, Moses has eased Asher''s fear of dogs so hopefully Asher won''t claw us tightly next time he sees a dog on the sidewalks of SF.</div></div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TR4QHPEHcDI/AAAAAAAACHY/UzqnIxW6JRE/s1600/Family.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TR4QHPEHcDI/AAAAAAAACHY/UzqnIxW6JRE/s320/Family.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></div><div>10 o''clock: My family talks all the time at the same time. Yet, somehow, we understand each other. And if we''re not talking about something, we''re taking a picture of it! Other than that we played Settlers of Catan and video games, ate our La Parilla dip, and the Varsity downtown before adding to the 89,000 people at the Georgia Aquarium. I always say my family goes and goes and doesn''t know how to stop! That''s why we have to fly home! </div><div><br></div><div>Time.

It comes natural for me to avoid confrontation and just sweep it under the rug. I would rather hold a grudge than come face to face with opposition. When Ben and I disagree, and though it happens less these days than in our first years of marriage, it works best for us to talk it over. The longer we wait, the more stubborn we get and the more that selfishness settles into our hearts. Ben and I both agree that at first in our marriage when there was a disagreement, we thought we had a major problem. We thought we were the only ones in the world that didn''t know how to communicate! Now we know we''re normal. I have learned that it''s even okay for our kids to see us disagree and work things out verbally in front of them. It''s healthy for them to see that mom and dad make mistakes with each other and know how to resolve them. Of course, be sensitive about this. They don''t need to hear every discussion. There are definitely times these conversations are best discussed behind closed doors! </div><div><br></div><div><span><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TQpeAA7GIGI/AAAAAAAACDM/zNIeREx5eCo/s320/DSC02799.jpg" border="0" alt=""></span></div><div><i><span>[The bell tower at Belmont University, Nashville, TN where we served on CentriFuge camp staff the summer of 1999]</span></i></div><div><i><span><br></span></i></div><div>2. Date nights are necessary. Maybe now more than ever! Date nights range from catching up on Law & Order:SVU with warm chocolate chip cookies fresh out of the oven after the kids are in bed to trying a new restaurant to enjoying a cup of coffee while browsing a bookstore. Date nights are simply setting aside some time just for the two of us to talk about anything and everything but work! </div><span><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TQpeAY7CdKI/AAAAAAAACDU/u34QkNcUh1k/s320/DSC02796.JPG" border="0" alt=""></span><div><span><i>[favorite coffee shop hangout on our camp summer nights across from Belmont]</i></span></div><div><span><i><br></i></span></div><div>3. Love what he loves. Ben and I could not be more opposite! He loves meat. I like veggies. He loves spontaneity. I love a schedule. He loves going. I love staying. He sees the big picture. I see the details. Yet, marriage is far more fulfilling when you embrace what your spouse loves. Ben models this far better than I. He listens when I want to read him my writings. He takes me to musicals and the ballet. He eats the food I love to cook. He will flow with my schedule, even if it means giving up the spontaneity! I am in a constant state of learning sports. In fact, I watched more SportsCenter in my first month of marriage than in my lifetime. And when it comes to sharing a meal, we both win...I take a bite of the steak and give him the rest and he takes a bite of the veggies and I get the rest!</div><div><br></div><span><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TQpd_lrq9eI/AAAAAAAACC8/LXYxQ1OkuWg/s320/DSC02802.JPG" border="0" alt=""></span><div><span>[my gift to Ben: a fairy tale book and an angel made from my wedding dress]</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div>4. Compliment publicly. As the wife, I am the one that has all the bragging rights for my husband. Well, not all of them! His mom and dad did a great job! But when I''m out with girlfriends, I want my words about Ben to describe him in such a way that honors him. I have no reason to talk down of him before others. Our marriage is far from perfect for we are imperfect people. Yet, what I say about our marriage should encourage others in their marriage. What I say about my husband should spur others on to godliness. Scriptures say that we are to praise our husbands at the city gates. (Proverbs 31) And I definitely have much to say about my man!</div><div><br></div><span><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TQpd_7sEzzI/AAAAAAAACDE/_Mq2OYWJXAk/s320/DSC02798.jpg" border="0" alt=""></span><div><span>[Ben reading the story I wrote for him on the front steps of Bongo Java earlier this month - right back where our friendship began]</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div>5. Celebrate the commitment. Commitments have lost meaning over time. As our previous generation would say, "They''re not what they used to be." In fact, I would venture out and say it''s rare and exciting when you can rejoice with couples who are happily enjoying their marriages. Celebrations are a way to say, "we''ve made it to this point" or "look how far we''ve come!" Every year that passes in our commitment to one another is a celebratory moment. </div><div><br></div><span><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TQuYVOjB5GI/AAAAAAAACD0/AKobAzjiXE4/s320/IMG_0245.jpg" border="0" alt=""></span><div>6. Surround your marriage with another couple. Ben and I learned this a few years ago. Someone had suggested for each of us to have a dear friend with whom you can confide in regarding marriage. Your spouse should also agree on this dear friend. This married friend is one who can ask the hard questions like, "Are you serving your spouse selflessly? Are you making time for them? Did you have your date night this week? Were you intimate with each other? Do your kids know that you love him? Are you looking forward together? Did you speak kind words about him in front of others?" This sharpening of one another''s marriages puts a gate on the marriage door allowing accountability in, yet keeping a close guard on the details of the marriage. We would both say our marriage is healthier for having this sweet fun couple in our lives.</div><div><br></div><span><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TQuT0Ar4CAI/AAAAAAAACDc/TtCpO70guKw/s320/IMG_0231.JPG" border="0" alt=""></span><div><span>[sweet fun couple - Dan and Meredith]</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div>7. Be happy or be right! This was Ben''s contribution to the list! My Papa passed down this great wisdom! I think enough is said.</div><div><br></div><div>8. Endure. Not in a ''put up with'' kind of a way, but in a ''I''m in this for the long haul'' kind of a way. Which means if you''re gonna endure, you have to lay aside selfishness and the right to be right. You have to think long-term and not just in the present moment. It''s in those present moments where we want to give up-when we''ve had it-when we are tired. We have learned to take a step back, evaluate what really matters, and look at each other and say, "let''s get through this together." And the beautiful reward that comes with endurance is stability and consistency. We strive for a marriage that is solid and will endure the test of time!</div><div><br></div><div>9. Share your story. If there is something I love to talk about it is marriage. And if there''s a group I love to talk with it''s young women. I have had the privilege of speaking into young ladies'' lives as they prepare for marriage and getting random texts throughout their early years about their new journey. Ben and I enjoy giving pre-marital counseling and always seem refreshed and challenged in our own marriage after each talk. Ben and I try our best to live out our story before others. We share the joys and the struggles. We do this because there''s enough media coverage on how to break up and move on to greener pastures. We want to tell the world that it''s Christ who is our foundation and our hope. Our joy and our peace. </div><div><br></div><span><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TQuVJyjmM4I/AAAAAAAACDs/0waumU3DEtI/s320/DSC02878.JPG" border="0" alt=""></span><div><span><i>[Andrew and Ashley''s wedding 12.5.10 - former students in our ministry in AL]</i></span></div><div><span><i><br></i></span></div><div>10.

The kind with whipped cream at the top drizzled with caramel or chocolate. The kind that is more of a dessert and is loaded with extra calories. The kind that costs $4.65 rather than a regular cup for $1.65.</div><div>But like every good cup of frou-frou coffee, the best part is the top! You sip the whipped cream to have it give you a mustache and the caramel never tasted so sweet! It''s only when you get to the bottom that the cream and caramel is gone and there''s the rarity of finding coffee grinds or simply just the bottom of the mug. </div><div>Giving is like a cup of frou-frou coffee. I want to give from the overflow of the cup (my heart). I don''t want to just be a cup of regular joe. I want to be the whipped cream and the sweet caramel. The idea sounds so nice, right? </div><div>_______________</div><div><br></div><div>Elijah''s birthday was 6 weeks ago and he received a few Target gift cards from family. Like any child, he couldn''t wait to get to the toy section of the store. As we were driving to Target, Elijah asked his brothers what would they get at Target if they had a gift card. (Now in my mind I''m thinking this is a sick joke Elijah is playing on his younger brothers, but I allowed conversation to continue.) Asher, of course, said baseball and Sam spatted out a list he had been keeping in his head in case the question ever presented itself.</div><div><br></div><div>"I''ll tell you what, I will get you each something with my gift cards," Elijah said.</div><div><br></div><div>"Now Elijah, that''s very nice of you, but this is your birthday gifts. Their birthdays are coming up soon. I don''t want you to promise them something that you can''t keep." I was trying to avoid a backfire.</div><div><br></div><div>After I gathered a few items at the store, we carted over to the toy section and looked around with our hands touching every toy, of course.</div><div><br></div><div>"Asher, what do you want to get?" Elijah was serious. I couldn''t believe this.</div><div><br></div><div>"Baseball!" Asher shouted. We traveled with the cart down to the sports section. Asher picked up a glove his size.</div><div><br></div><div>"Ok, Asher. Now Sam, what do you want?" Elijah asked.</div><div><br></div><div>"I wanna go back and look at the toys!" Sam said excitedly.</div><div><br></div><div>Sam picked out a Star Wars action figure.</div><div><br></div><div>Elijah then took time to pick out a Star Wars Lego set and we all made it to the checkout counter. </div><div><br></div><div>As a parent, I was still in shock at all that I just witnessed. Elijah didn''t learn generosity from me. How is it that he spends his birthday money first and foremost on his brothers and then uses the rest for himself? How did he arrive at this thought in the first place? He didn''t owe them anything. He didn''t say, "Mom, I''ve learned many great things from you, one being how you always put others first!" </div><div><br></div><div>_______________</div><div><br></div><div><i>Selfishness comes natural. Generosity is learned. </i></div><div><br></div><div>I turn back over my shoulders and see my father-in-law, Mr. Joe, who quietly and humbly gives his life and his resources to those in need. He gives to his children and by doing so, Ben, my husband, has learned generosity.  I see my mom who would give the very pink jacket off her </div><div>back if needed. "I don''t need anything," she says, "But let me get you something." Her generosity stretches to missionaries overseas to the poor children in her town.  I see hundreds of people who are giving to our church in the city. I see other family members and friends. I see lives of long ago whose generosity stories live on.</div><div><br></div><div>The only way I can see if generosity is being learned and applied in my own life is to look forward. Whose lives am I investing in? How am I selflessly serving my husband? Will my children rise up and call me blessed? (Proverbs 31) What needs are around me that pierce my heart and move me to action? </div><div><br></div><div>Looking back are the examples. Looking forward is the need. Looking back is the example of my 7 year old. Yet my son is still before me as the need. That''s the wonderment of God. Through His grace (getting something we don''t deserve) and the gift of today, I have the privilege of practicing generosity again. </div><div>_______________</div><div><br></div><span><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TNVwWZKS6UI/AAAAAAAAB8k/x8lrBfRtZoQ/s320/images.jpeg" border="0" alt=""></span><div>How can we be the whipped cream and the sweet caramel?

That makes 132 San Franciscans, 23 of which were a part of Epic Kids.</div><div><br></div><div>Our new friends, Dan, Jen, and Marco came because they received a granola bar and an invite card a few days before the preview service. To their surprise, they met up with Mary, a friend of theirs and a friend of ours! Mary shares Alabama connections with us and graciously volunteered to help with Epic Kids check-in.</div><div><br></div><div>At least a dozen friends from the city who are connected at other churches/ministries came to show their support. Just making eye contact, receiving a head shake, or embracing with a hug, confirmed their encouragement.</div><div><br></div><div>Carol came at the very end and said she was grateful a church is nearby her apartment. Her husband handed her the invite he had received on the street and encouraged her to go. She hopes and prays her husband will join her for the next preview.</div><div><br></div><div>Eric, Joey, and Ian had agreed to greet at this first service. Eric, who is new to church, led the way in reaching out and welcoming those who came.</div><div><br></div><div>Tom, who is a part of our launch team, had to miss the service because of Little League, but was there through the entire setting up process. </div><div><br></div><div>Michelle, who is a part of our launch team, stepped right into Epic Kids and served greatly. She shared with me how well this had come together and how great everything looked. I expressed that she was a part of it all!</div><div><br></div><div>D. has lived in the city for over a year and hasn''t found a church quite like the one she went to in Dallas. She told Ben that she felt at home at Epic.</div><div><br></div><div>Whitney and Jon who are new to the city and were very active in their home church in Michigan showed up with coffee for the set-up team at 6 am. They were amazing servants the whole day!</div><div><br></div><div>2 pastor''s wives from 2 of our partnering CA churches came to work. They brought their kids along, leaving their husbands back at their home churches. Karen''s church (Crossroads in Fremont) helped start Staci''s church (South Bay in Santa Clara). This Sunday, both beautiful ladies were at Epic to help it get started.</div><div><br></div><div>3 UCSF Mission Bay students attended. Ben is privileged to enjoy coffee and lunch with a few of them this week. Some are interested in joining our launch team.</div><div><br></div><div>Two women wrote Ben emails before the preview service sharing their gratitude and perfect timing of receiving the postcard in the mail. Both attended. One commented after the service at how well prepared and thought out the service and set up was. She appreciated the warm welcome she received. </div><div><br></div><div>One person wrote on their comment card that they were interested in becoming a Christian. </div><div><br></div><div>The offering taken up at the end of the service was 100% given to Bessie Carmichael School in our neighborhood. Epic is proud to partner with this school to provide supplies for teachers who are otherwise using their own money. People gave generously.</div><div><br></div><div>Ben shared the story of Zacchaeus from the book of Luke. Zacchaeus not only didn''t do life with others, but took life from others as he charged too much for taxes in his day. Obviously, he didn''t have many friends. Zacchaeus became desperate as he climbed the tree to seek Jesus. The beautiful part of the story is that Jesus was seeking out Zacchaeus and is seeking us out today. We all have a little bit of Zacchaeus in us. Think about it...we don''t teach our kids to be selfish! But a transformation took place in the life of Zacchaeus. Ben shared that he went from accruing wealth at the expense of others to serving others at the expense of himself.  Ben challenged us that life is meant to be shared! How will I share my life with others this week!? For Sunday was so much fun in sharing life with new friends and starting a new church in this city!</div><div><br></div><div>These stories made possible by God''s goodness!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>', 'Epic Stories of Sharing Life', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'epic-stories-of-sharing-life', '', '', '2013-02-11 08:10:21', '2013-02-11 16:10:21', '', 0, 'http://demo.inspiredcauses.com/?p=195', 0, 'post', '', 0),

We want to be like these heroes because they have accomplished something great.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span></span><br></span></span></p><p><span><b><span><span>Everyday heroes </span></span></b><span><span>like definition 1d are people such as police officers, fire fighters, soldiers, and doctors. But everyday heroes also includes people with disabilities or with sickness that continue to battle to live and enjoy life. Everyday heroes are those who come to the rescue, big or small, and help others out without expecting anything in return.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span></span><br></span></span></p><p><span><b><span><span>Jesus </span></span></b><span><span>like definition 2 is the central figure throughout time that has done what no other has done for all mankind and that is dying for our sins so that we might live. </span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span></span><br></span></span></p><p><span><b><span><span>False heroes </span></span></b><span><span>like definition 4 are images or people who are </span></span><i><span><span>like</span></span></i><span><span> heroes, but are </span></span><b><span><span>not</span></span></b><span><span> truly heroes. They don’t fit the definition of a hero because maybe they don’t make the right choices. Maybe they lie about being a hero and trick us into thinking they are brave and courageous. These false heroes are called idols. They want our attention and they want us to be like them, but they are taking our focus off of living life to the fullest. </span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Sometimes we create these false heroes in our minds when we get forget what is right and true.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span></span><br></span></span></p><p><span><span><b><i><span>Game</span></i></b></span></span></p><p><span><span>Place action figures out in front and give the boys 30 seconds to look at all of them.

Ben and his spontaneous, adventurous self wanted to see who could hit the ball into the bay. (Wait a second, I said I was gonna brag on myself...) So, we went through the batting order again. He was kind enough to let us all go first, thinking he would bat last and be the one to put it in the bay. HOWEVER, it was my turn to bat and with a strong swing of the bat, I put the ball into the bay! Ben quickly ran to the edge to see if maybe it landed among the rocks and could be retrieved, but no, it was bobbing up and down in the water! The boys couldn''t believe that mom did that...and I think Ben was the most surprised of all! </div><div><br></div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TE9jrMG-AxI/AAAAAAAABss/EgHOyMk3MYk/s1600/DSC02305.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/TE9jrMG-AxI/AAAAAAAABss/EgHOyMk3MYk/s320/DSC02305.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><div>It''s the Sand Monster! Sam, Elijah and I created this creature on the beach at Half Moon Bay just 30 miles south of the city. Only its head comes out of the sand to peek around and see what kids are digging in the sand.

Hundreds of people made the swap from sitting under the teaching of Pastor Marshall to branching out to hear this new guy and be led by a band rather than an orchestra and choir. In our time at Second Baptist and in particular at the secondeleven service, we witnessed God''s presence and salvation. We watched and participated in our church''s heart for missions locally and globally.

Christians must have empathy towards others. We are not called up put up with something and turn our back because there’s nothing we can do. Instead, we must engage in other’s lives and hear their stories and learn their needs, whether we agree with their lifestyle or not. </span></span><span><br></span><ol></ol><p><span>We were asked in a small group session, “in what ways do i disqualify myself from being a church planter’s wife?” I answer honestly with: a lack of education beyond a college degree, white girl, southern background and accent. We were then asked to draw a circle of concern. What in my new neighborhood concerns me? Then we were asked to draw a circle of influence. What in my circle of concern can I have influence in?  “You usually can’t do something about everything you’re concerned about.”      B. Salter-McNeil</span><span><span></span></span></p><ol></ol><p><span>“There comes a time in every person’s life when they are given a unique opportunity to discover the purpose for which they are born. It is their moment of destiny and if they seize it, it is their finest hour.”    Sir Winston Churchill (obviously not present at conference, but quoted!)</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><span><span>It matters WHO you love like not WHO you look like.   S. Claiborne</span></span></div><div><span><span><span><br></span></span></span><span><span>“Some need rescuing from the ghetto and some need rescuing from the cul-de-sac.”   S. Claiborne</span></span><span><br></span><ol></ol><p><span>“God is not man, that he should lie, or a son of man, that he should change his mind. Has he said, and will he not do it?

My emotions and my heart are tied directly to where I''m at in the process. And the beautiful and intricate part of all of this is how our process affects others. It can encourage or discourage. It can challenge and burden. </span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>So, I ask myself, "Where am I at in each process?" and "What am I learning?

Her sweet spirit and godly leadership are attractive.

We are finding as we research public schools in San Francisco, that the process can be stressful, yet adventurous as if digging for a hidden treasure. As one San Francisco parent put it, "the reason you are finding it stressful is probably because there are so many good choices.  It''s really more like choosing a college than anything else, just a lot earlier than you were expecting to have such fun options.

We pray specifically that they would realize as young boys that every human is born into this world as a sinner - that there is nothing good in them that they can do to earn heaven or to gain a right standing with God. Deuteronomy 6:5-9 has been our family Scripture passage for this 2009-2010 school year and we do our best to practice consistently the art of speaking about Jesus and using teachable moments in everyday life. We read the Storybook Bible in the evening as a family and always bring the story back to what Jesus did for us on the cross because that''s the central part of the Gospel. We pray aloud over the boys at night asking God to show Himself to them and that they would trust with childlike faith. As parents, we strongly believe that God works his grace in their hearts and they respond in faith without manipulation. We wait patiently and expectantly for the Holy Spirit to convict their hearts.  We let our boys know that Jesus is the greatest gift ever and that nothing compares to Him. Our boys know how much we love them, but we tell them that no matter how they act or what they say, that God loves them far more and deeper still. Because of our strong beliefs and prayers to see our boys follow Jesus with all their hearts, what happened on Thursday, January 7th, was a beautiful picture of answered prayer and great rejoicing!<br><br>Over the past year, Elijah has become more curious and more knowledgeable of the Gospel of Christ. It''s such a blessing that he has rich heritage of godly grandparents. His Upwards basketball coaches, AWANA leaders, Sunday School teachers, friends, and other family members have spoken truth into his life and live a Christ-filled life before him.This past fall, Elijah got some Bible story CDs from Mimi and Pops. He chooses to listen to them nightly as he falls asleep. He is memorizing Scripture and wants to know what the verses mean. He has compassion for his classmates'' needs and we hear that in his prayers for them. In the past few months as we have noticed this curiosity about salvation, we have been intentional to ask him questions directed to his own heart. Elijah often would reply with, "I''m not ready," or "I''m don''t want to talk about it right now." We wouldn''t press it. We, too, had to be prompted by the Holy Spirit, just as we were praying for the Holy Spirit to do His work in our son.<br><br><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/S0ej0h24lGI/AAAAAAAABFg/Vt-klrYMAE0/s1600-h/DSC01432.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/S0ej0h24lGI/AAAAAAAABFg/Vt-klrYMAE0/s320/DSC01432.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><br><br>On Thursday, January 7, the kids were out of school because of the weather and Ben was getting hyped up for the big BCS Championship game between Alabama and Texas. Shauna and the boys were making paper snowflakes where Shauna made a brown snowflake while the boys were decorating their white snowflakes. (Remember, we look for teachable moments throughout our day.) The boys were laughing at the dirty snowflake I was creating saying it looked like the mushy dirty snow on the sides of the street. Shauna asked them how our hearts resembled the brown snowflake. Elijah knew the answer, like he often does. He said that our hearts are full of sin that is dirty and mushy. I asked, "How do our hearts become pure like the white snowflake?" Elijah answered, "You ask God to forgive you of your sins and to clean you up." We continued to talk a few more minutes. I then asked, "Elijah, what is keeping you from having a heart that is pure and white as snow?" He said that he wanted to go upstairs for a while. And as always, we don''t want to pressure them, so I assumed conversation was over and that he was done with crafts for the day.<br>About 10-15 minutes later, Elijah came downstairs and said, "Mom, I''ve been talking with Jesus upstairs." To which I replied, "About what?" Elijah told me that he had asked God to forgive him of his sins and that he believed that Jesus died on the cross for his sins. Elijah went on to say that he gave his life to Jesus. "OKAY!" I said joyfully. We called Ben and he made plans to be home early so that we could talk and rejoice together. <br>That afternoon, Ben spent a few minutes confirming what we already believe happened earlier that day. We told our son that his salvation is sealed and that he has a home in heaven. We also let him know that the Holy Spirit lives in him and will guide him and let him know when he messes up. We told Elijah that all of heaven is rejoicing! So we rejoiced with him. Then Elijah, without our help, took a minute to pray and thank God for saving him and forgiving him. <br><br>Though Alabama became BCS Champions that night, nothing compares to our son, Elijah, becoming a Christ-follower!

The boys and I were painting cards for upcoming birthdays, when I realized that the boys would need a bath before we went out for Chickfila''s Family Night. <br>"Since they are gonna need a bath anyway, I should go ahead and cut their hair instead of waiting until tomorrow," I thought.<br>I began the process with Asher since his fingers were smudged in blue paint. I used a certain guard on his head and trimmed around the neck and his ears. He was happy to be done and played in the backyard while I called for Sam.<br>Now you must know that we save over $45 a month for haircuts. The older two like the buzz cut and Asher doesn''t like haircuts from the kid-friendly salon or me, so I might as well do it myself for free, right? He''s getting better at it.<br>So Sam sits down on the stool outside. Here''s where the mistake happens...<br><br>I had taken off the guard that I used for Asher and then called for Sam. Without thinking about it, I began to buzz Sam''s hair from the back of the neck upwards and froze. <br>"Oh, no," I shouted and cried simultaneously. I blinked, hoping that I was dreaming. Elijah scurried to see what I was crying about. I had started off buzzing Sam''s head with no guard.<br>"That''s so cool!" he shouted.<br>Because of Elijah''s excitement, Sam was excited.<br>There was nothing else I could do. After pulling myself together, I reluctantly proceeded to shave his entire head with NO guard.  Sam got off the stool and peered into the house window to discover it all gone. He had a confused look on his face. <br>Elijah said,"Mom, do that to my hair." <br>Now, I didn''t like the haircut AT ALL. My boys have no hair and I know it will take a few weeks for it to grow back. But I thought, maybe cutting Elijah''s hair the same way would encourage Sam.<br>So, again, I reluctantly proceeded to shave Elijah''s entire head. <br>My motto has always been, "Hair grows," but it has always been a personal motto, not a family motto. As I watched my three boys play around in the backyard, I had to simply embrace that I made a mistake, but it''s one that fixes itself. Hair does grow! At least for most of our family!<br>We made it in for baths to get paint and shaved hair off. Sam had a moment when he had to scrub his head. He didn''t like the way it felt. I told him that it would grow back. When it was time to get dressed, the thought of pulling a shirt over the somewhat bald head bothered him. I chose a button up shirt for him instead. Then as I was quickly getting myself ready to leave, he came and asked me if he could wear a hat tonight. This is highly unusual for Sam. I could tell he was REALLY sensitive about what I had done to him.<br>"Of course, you can!" I said with a big smile and picked him up. I wanted to make it up to him tonight by treating him to a special time out and about. We made it to Chickfila''s Family Fun Night and got to make suncatchers and make free sundaes. He had been asking me for a particular kind of underwear, so we make a special trip to get some. (And I paid more than I wanted to, but again, I save $45 a month on haircuts and completely shaved every hair off my son''s head tonight!)<br>So tonight I feel the weight of this mistake. I can''t stand it that I did this to Sam and that it made him extremely sensitive this evening. My heart broke to see him cry over his image and then I realized that more than any other person in the world, I (and Ben) have the privilege of showing and telling Sam who he is and how much he is loved. <br><br><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/SnJfm2S0LnI/AAAAAAAAAzU/JMXEqN8aJlM/s1600-h/DSC00623.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/SnJfm2S0LnI/AAAAAAAAAzU/JMXEqN8aJlM/s320/DSC00623.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/SnJfnLvvrpI/AAAAAAAAAzc/y6MJLN7SOKw/s1600-h/DSC00622.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/SnJfnLvvrpI/AAAAAAAAAzc/y6MJLN7SOKw/s320/DSC00622.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><br><br>They are still the most handsome boys I have ever laid eyes on!', 'A Mother''s Worst Mistake (or at least it feels like that today!)', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'a-mothers-worst-mistake-or-at-least-it-feels-like-that-today', '', '', '2009-07-31 03:00:00', '2009-07-31 03:00:00', '', 0, 'http://demo.inspiredcauses.com/?p=306', 0, 'post', '', 12),

We love learning about how to serve one another and thank God for His protection and blessing over our marriage of eight and a half years.<br>Here''s some of Shauna''s favorite notes:<br>* Ladies were challenged to ask ourselves, "How well do you pursue your husband?"<br>* Once you marry, you become your spouse''s standard of beauty! If you''ve got a long neck, your husband is ''in'' to long necks. If you''re blonde, your husband loves blonde. When you turn gray, your husband is now into gray!<br>* Your bedroom should be inviting. (For us, no toys, no cell phones, clutter free)<br>* We''re not gonna make the other person just like us. We want them to be like Jesus. So get functional and let some things go.<br>* Don''t get a new spouse (divorce). Get a new marriage (recommitment).<br>* Put wedding album in a place that is visible to others and you.<br>* Not in the mood? Start and God will honor obedience! <br>* Be a private garden, not a public park. (chapter 4, verse 12)<br>* The last day of marriage (the day you or your spouse dies) is more important than the first day of marriage (wedding day). We plan our weddings and not our funerals. People go for the minimum and say if we don''t have a divorce or commit adultery, we''ve made it. Live your marriage as you want to go out.<br>* Be a loving doe, a graceful deer, wives.<br>* You can''t share your bodies if you''re not sharing your souls. <br>* More intimacy? Pray together. Read God''s Word together. Follow Jesus daily...genuinely!<br><br>Ben adds his notes from the conference:<br>* For every person, sex is god, gross, or a gift. <br>* Just as Driscoll did at this conference, sex and great marriages have to continued to be talke about in church.<br>* Men pray over their wives.<br>* There''s selfish lovers and servant lovers.<br>* He also ''stars'' all the ones mentioned above!<br><br>One of Ben''s favorite authors and pastors is Mark Driscoll.

I get the impression that some people think that I''ve been given a <em></em>tough<em></em> load to carry or that I''m being punished to raise 3 boys. I certainly understand the girl thing. I''m one of three girls. Pigtails, baby dolls, sweet sounds, playing quietly, and cute clothes were a part of it. Girls have their <em>tough</em> side too...drama, grudges, and attitudes! <br>I can''t imagine life any other way! Someone came to visit me just after we brought Elijah home from the hospital. She had two young boys and shared with me her thought of raising boys: maybe God was growing His army of boys by giving families the privilege of raising warriors for His Kingdom and His glory and His renown. I think of that idea often. <strong>I am privileged.</strong> I have a big responsibility of raising three precious warriors who will prayerfully fight for truth and speak for life and share the Gospel and will love a woman one day like Christ loves the church. <br>So how did taking pictures of my boys at a nearby amusement park spur these deep thoughts on? I''m not quite sure. I''m just certain that I love what God has called me to do: to train them in the way of truth, to love them and others with the love of my Savior, and to exemplify a godly marriage.

(333, 2, '2009-01-07 13:03:00', '2009-01-07 13:03:00', 'As a family, we have begun the year like so many others...with a list of goals to accomplish in 2009. As a couple, we came up with practical ways to carry out our goals. Our family goals and several of our personal goals are similar giving us some accountability together. <br><br>After a time of unwinding and gearing up for the new year this weekend, I began with a thought...why do we buy homes big enough for our families? Is it truly because as <em>people </em>we need the space or is it that our <em>stuff </em>needs the space? We believe that our home is just the right size for our family. However, it''s so easy in our culture to fill every corner, shelf, and closet with stuff. Hence the reason for two of my goals.<br><br>My first goal: to simplify. I''m really good about ''borrowing'' other people''s great ideas. A friend told me of her 25 meal plan which is to cook 5 different meals a week with a 5 week rotation. This will keep us eating at home, eating more healthy, and saving money and time with a thought-out plan. So far the first three meals have been <em>keepers</em>! My next goal goes hand-in-hand with this goal, but as I organize stuff, I get rid of stuff, making cleaning simplier and requiring less time, which makes more time for the more important things!<br><br>My second goal: to organize. All CDs will be put on itunes. All DVDs will be taken out of their cases and put in a DVD album. Clothes that haven''t been worn in a year will be given away, donated, or consigned. All paperwork will be sorted through. All my Southern Livings and Paula Deen magazines will be sorted through as I tear out my favorite recipes and put them in a binder. I think I''ll see if our church or other ministry could use the magazines for preschool cut-outs.<br><br>My third goal: to memorize. This week it''s Psalm 73.28 and Jeremiah 32.38-41. Over the past two years, I have prayed for a desire to know His Word and to hide it in my heart. As a mom of three little ones, it''s hard to find uninterrupted time to do in-depth Bible studies. In addition to my daily retreats with my Father, I can memorize Scripture throughout the day. I take the notecard with me in the van, to the kitchen, and hold it as I rock Asher. I just memorize verses that come to my heart as I am with Him and that speak truth of where I am now and where/who I desire to be.<br><br>My forth goal: to prioritize. I''m a calendar/task-oriented girl. So with my calendar in front of me, I begin the week writing down my goals. I make sure that my retreat time, Ben time, family time, meal plan, workouts, and date nights are written down first. Then I can go back and fill in appointments and tasks. <br><br>Because of the goodness of God, the love of my husband, and the joy of our children, I set out to be all that our gracious Father desires me to be! <br><br>Happy New Year!', 'Simplify and Organize and Memorize and Prioritize!', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'simplify-and-organize-and-memorize-and-prioritize', '', '', '2009-01-07 13:03:00', '2009-01-07 13:03:00', '', 0, 'http://demo.inspiredcauses.com/?p=333', 0, 'post', '', 5),

The 11:00 worship service will be band led by our dear friend, Ryan Myers, who came up here from Tuscaloosa after leading in worship with us at Calvary. Ben will be teaching on a weekly basis beginning the 24th. It''s nothing short of a miracle in what God has done in Ben''s life. In college, he dropped his speech class, afraid of standing before his classmates and delivering a speech. Now, God is using him to speak to the masses! How great is our God! Ben, if you''ve never heard him speak, is gifted with a very relational style of teaching. It''s very easy to understand what he is trying to communicate and it seems as if you are the only one in the crowd because of how personal he makes it. He is passionate about the Word of God and allows it to come alive when he teaches. He has been working very hard in the 4 1/2 months we have been here to get to know our church family and community and to prepare for the months that await us. We are trusting God to honor the prayers of His people as Second Baptist has bathed these new changes in prayer. We want God to be exalted as we reach out to the unchurched, to our neighbors, college students, and the greater Springfield area. May people feel welcomed at Second. <br>Also, Elijah and Sam start preschool next Monday and Tuesday. I''m excited about having a few hours in my day to run errands with just one child rather than three and getting to meet with ladies in our community and church.

Many were shared during our sessions on marriage and family:<br><br>1. When Ben comes home and I ask, "How was your day?" I''m really just wanting to come alongside him and be on the same page. I''m not wanting him to relive his day. It simply helps if I know how he is doing emotionally and spiritually so that we can walk hand in hand for the rest of the day. <br>2. When talking with our kids, we must be the same voice coming from different mouths. Tell the kids, "This is what the Pilgreens do" or "Mom and dad say this." This way they can''t use us against the other.<br>3. I''m the processor-out-louder. I think out loud from beginning to end. Ben processes in his mind and then shares the final outcome. He is learning patience as he must listen to my entire process to simply arrive at the solution. I''m learning that I am not a failure for having to do it all verbally. <br>4. Husbands are not our enemy...We fight a battle we cannot see against Satan. Ephesians 6:12<br>5. Don''t wait for your husband to act. Do what God expects of you.<br>6. Our culture is doing everything to pull our marriage apart. We must be on our knees daily to keep our marriage together. <br>7. As wives, we can be bubble poppers. We need to be cheerleaders. Let your man dream!<br>8. I stiffle Ben''s growth and leadership when I don''t let him lead or take initiative.<br>9. Sometimes men feel more needed at work because they receive more praise there. May he receive more at home!<br>10. Our daily task seems to keep our home sane and under control. But there is a bigger perspective. It''s not about raising our kids to make us look good or surviving the day or making them happy. Parenting is a gift. Treat it as such.<br><br><br>To top it off, Anthony Evans, made a surprise visit at camp on Friday. He is the son of Tony Evans, pastor in Dallas, and sister to Priscilla Shirer, author and Bible study teacher. He grew up attending and working Pine Cove and wrote an amazing song about our first impressions that we make on our children. <br>Below are the lyrics. May they bless your heart as they did ours.<br><br><br><em>When I held you in my arms, I knew that heaven must have sent the greatest gift I''ve ever known, nothing compares to this. When I held you in my arms and touched your tiny face, I got down on my knees and with all my heart I prayed:<br><br>Let my first impression be, Lord, that you are alive and living in me. And in all that I say and all that I do, God, let my life be a reflection of you. <br><br>You are growing up before me and I''m proud of what I see. By His mercy you''re becoming all He''s made you to be. With every step you take, you''re moving further from my side, and as your life unfolds, I pray you live a life that cries: <br><br>Let my first impression be, Lord, that you are alive and living in me. And in all that I say and all that I do, God, let my life be a reflection of you.<br><br>Someday you''ll have your own kids, little reflections of you, and I pray that you''ll pray this prayer too!</em>', 'Lessons from Vacation', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'lessons-from-vacation', '', '', '2008-06-30 19:15:00', '2008-06-30 19:15:00', '', 0, 'http://demo.inspiredcauses.com/?p=365', 0, 'post', '', 2),

We met many new families, rode wave runners, ate soo much, swam, rode horses, rode boats and water rockets, paddle boats, canoes, dressed silly for theme nights, cheered, ate smores, played war ball, got our faces painted, sang songs, attended sessions on marriage and parenting, reunited with some of our former students, and so much more.

Being a teaching pastor at Second will be what I do, not who I am.  I am a son of God and Christ is in me and I pray that everything else I do flows from that.

He wants to be glorified in Tuscaloosa and our new city, Springfield. <br>Thank you for your prayers as we traveled.

But the moment that will forever stand out took place in a waterfront village called Whittier. To make a very long story short, there was nothing opened in the town. The only way into the village was through a 2.5 mile tunnel through the mountain. Once we got through the tunnel literally closed down and we could not leave the town for an hour and a half. We drove up to an apartment building and saw a man who had just killed a bear who had attempted to break into his home. He shot him in the head and the bullet came out through the mouth. It was incredible to see. However, the entire time in the town seemed like a horror film. We felt trapped and had no way to escape. It was completely desolate except for the man who killed the bear!

(2 Peter 3:9)<br>Pray that they will experience sanctification through the transforming work of the Holy Spirit and will increasingly desire to fulfill the greatest commandments.

(Philippians 4:8) By the way, I pray this verse over Elijah nightly as he struggles with letting his imagination run wild leading to bad dreams. <br>Pray that their hearts will be stirred to give generously to the Lord''s work.

They are not be said light-hearted. And be prepared for God to answer them by teaching us as parents a thing or two. Our children are a gift that come with a responsibility of raising them to fear and know the Lord. <br>Our children haven''t even come to faith in Christ yet, but we pray these prayers for them at an early age. My parents released me back to God at a young age and because of their willingness, God is allowing them to see the fruits of those prayers as Ben and I have served long-term and short-term in Mexico, Florida, Alabama, Alaska, India, China, Louisiana, Texas, Missouri, Virginia, and soon California.', '', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '305-revision', '', '', '2009-08-01 20:22:00', '2009-08-01 20:22:00', '', 305, 'http://demo.inspiredcauses.com/305-revision/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

We drove along Seward Highway, just minutes from Anchorage.

It was evident in his preaching. I could also hear it in his voice when he shared with me about this series of Esther taking risks. The pieces came together as he asked me to pray about church planting. With a deep breath and a wavering trust, I answered him, “I’ll do that. I’ll pray. Give me a few days.”</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">I began to think about how good we had it. We had a nice home in a safe neighborhood. Ben was in a good situation at the church where we served. The senior pastor was a mentor who poured daily into Ben. We loved our church. Our friends. We were at a great school and were within driving distance to family. We even had tickets to Silver Dollar City! Was God calling us to give all that up? I began to pray.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">We’re not promised this good life here on earth. But we are promised that God will never leave us. That He goes before us. As a young girl, I had already told God that I’d go anywhere. But Africa was more on the radar than an urban setting in North America! Ben and I began to talk about the "non-negotiables"—what we could sacrifice and what we wouldn’t. We could give up being a two-car family, owning a home, living somewhat close to family. We wouldn’t sacrifice our marriage, our children’s best interests or their education. This was it. Our journey was starting. As best as I can describe it, we held hands, looked at each other, and stepped off the cliff into the great unknown of this faith journey into church planting.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">It became clear that God was calling us to plant a church in San Francisco. We knew we''d been called by God to the task and a peace began to fill our hearts. But when we made our initial trip to San Francisco, questions raced through my mind. Where will we live? Where are the playgrounds for our kids? Where will they go to school? What will our church look like? Am I prepared for this?</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">For the next year, I began to journal the process. We had made moves to other churches and other ministries, but this was different. This had far more unknowns. I recall telling Ben how overwhelmed I was with the research, information, and the process. My eyes would hurt from looking at all the school data online for the boys. I also recorded my prayers, “God, in Your presence this morning, I have overwhelmingly been reminded that You are holy, in control, and desire to receive glory through this process.”</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">We wrote a weekly prayer guide and continued to do so up until the move. In addition, I knew I needed a personal prayer base so I asked ten women to commit to pray for our family, for me. [I had no idea that three years later, I’d be emailing them still with requests and they’d still be committed to praying for us.]</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">I journaled about the petty and the monumental. Not knowing our housing situation, I began to sort through clothes and books. I posted furniture on craigslist. I donated, consigned, and gave stuff away. I knew our church plant would need nursery toys, so I boxed up personal baby toys our children had outgrown and marked the box, “Epic Church nursery.”</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">I made contact with a public school teacher in San Francisco. Our differences were quickly discussed. Me - a pastor’s wife. She - a Jewish lesbian. We set our differences aside and talked about that which we had in common. Her insight into the schools was so helpful. She was happy to know we wanted to move our family to the city and make a difference in a public school.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">We wouldn’t start weekly services for at least ten months after we move. If we were giving up church programming, who would teach our boys? I hand wrote a week of curriculum for them and coined it ‘Hero Boot Camp.’ We’d make it fun.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">Ben and I spent a few days learning from church planters in New York City.  We attended a church planting conference with our staff. While soaking in so much information, I came across this quote:</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">“There comes a time in every person’s life when they are given a unique opportunity to discover the purpose for which they are born. It is their moment of destiny and if they seize it, it is their finest hour.” [Sir Winston Churchill]</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">Well, our hour was drawing near. We made the move with the help of friends who drove out with Ben and the moving truck and flew out with me and the boys. With our feet on the ground in our new city, San Francisco, we had one mission: meet people. We invited people into our apartment. We began to share our story of why we were here in San Francisco. While Ben immersed himself in strategy for church planting in our target area, me and the boys immersed ourselves in the city. Within one month of moving, we held our first launch team meeting in our apartment. Gratitude came over me when the last person left our home that night; so grateful we were doing this as a family. God was gracious to remind me that we aren’t out here alone. He had already gone before us.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">Just recently, I looked back in my journal.

It was evident in his preaching. I could also hear it in his voice when he shared with me about this series of Esther taking risks. The pieces came together as he asked me to pray about church planting. With a deep breath and a wavering trust, I answered him, “I’ll do that. I’ll pray. Give me a few days.”</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">I began to think about how good we had it. We had a nice home in a safe neighborhood. Ben was in a good situation at the church where we served. The senior pastor was a mentor who poured daily into Ben. We loved our church. Our friends. We were at a great school and were within driving distance to family. We even had tickets to Silver Dollar City! Was God calling us to give all that up? I began to pray.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">We’re not promised this good life here on earth. But we are promised that God will never leave us. That He goes before us. As a young girl, I had already told God that I’d go anywhere. But Africa was more on the radar than an urban setting in North America! Ben and I began to talk about the "non-negotiables"—what we could sacrifice and what we wouldn’t. We could give up being a two-car family, owning a home, living somewhat close to family. We wouldn’t sacrifice our marriage, our children’s best interests or their education. This was it. Our journey was starting. As best as I can describe it, we held hands, looked at each other, and stepped off the cliff into the great unknown of this faith journey into church planting.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">It became clear that God was calling us to plant a church in San Francisco. We knew we''d been called by God to the task and a peace began to fill our hearts. But when we made our initial trip to San Francisco, questions raced through my mind. Where will we live? Where are the playgrounds for our kids? Where will they go to school? What will our church look like? Am I prepared for this?</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">For the next year, I began to journal the process. We had made moves to other churches and other ministries, but this was different. This had far more unknowns. I recall telling Ben how overwhelmed I was with the research, information, and the process. My eyes would hurt from looking at all the school data online for the boys. I also recorded my prayers, “God, in Your presence this morning, I have overwhelmingly been reminded that You are holy, in control, and desire to receive glory through this process.”</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">We wrote a weekly prayer guide and continued to do so up until the move. In addition, I knew I needed a personal prayer base so I asked ten women to commit to pray for our family, for me. [I had no idea that three years later, I’d be emailing them still with requests and they’d still be committed to praying for us.]</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">I journaled about the petty and the monumental. Not knowing our housing situation, I began to sort through clothes and books. I posted furniture on craigslist. I donated, consigned, and gave stuff away. I knew our church plant would need nursery toys, so I boxed up personal baby toys our children had outgrown and marked the box, “Epic Church nursery.”</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">I made contact with a public school teacher in San Francisco. Our differences were quickly discussed. Me - a pastor’s wife. She - a Jewish lesbian. We set our differences aside and talked about that which we had in common. Her insight into the schools was so helpful. She was happy to know we wanted to move our family to the city and make a difference in a public school.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">We wouldn’t start weekly services for at least ten months after we move. If we were giving up church programming, who would teach our boys? I hand wrote a week of curriculum for them and coined it ‘Hero Boot Camp.’ We’d make it fun.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">Ben and I spent a few days learning from church planters in New York City.  We attended a church planting conference with our staff. While soaking in so much information, I came across this quote:</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">“There comes a time in every person’s life when they are given a unique opportunity to discover the purpose for which they are born. It is their moment of destiny and if they seize it, it is their finest hour.” [Sir Winston Churchill]</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">Well, our hour was drawing near. We made the move with the help of friends who drove out with Ben and the moving truck and flew out with me and the boys. With our feet on the ground in our new city, San Francisco, we had one mission: meet people. We invited people into our apartment. We began to share our story of why we were here in San Francisco. While Ben immersed himself in strategy for church planting in our target area, me and the boys immersed ourselves in the city. Within one month of moving, we held our first launch team meeting in our apartment. Gratitude came over me when the last person left our home that night; so grateful we were doing this as a family. God was gracious to remind me that we aren’t out here alone. He had already gone before us.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">Just recently, I looked back in my journal. Just a few years ago I wrote, “As best as I can describe it, we held hands, looked at each other, and stepped figuratively off the cliff into the great unknown of faith.” And it’s been one of the best decisions ever made.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">okay, now leave a comment! i can''t wait to hear from you and give this book away!</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://demo.inspiredcauses.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/revised-moody-cover.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-579" alt="revised moody cover" src="http://demo.inspiredcauses.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/revised-moody-cover-199x300.jpg" width="199" height="300" /></a></p>', 'giveaway {The Church Planter''s Wife}', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '576-revision-3', '', '', '2013-02-07 21:42:50', '2013-02-08 05:42:50', '', 576, 'http://demo.inspiredcauses.com/576-revision-3/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Francisco</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">tony bennett says “he left his heart in san francisco.” i feel as if we got the better deal...our hearts <i>are</i> in san francisco.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">we love our city. it’s a growing, exploring love. it’s birthed out of our desire to claim jeremiah 33.9:</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><i>“and this city shall be to Me a name of joy, a praise and a glory before all the nations of the earth who shall hear of all the good I do for them. they shall fear and tremble because of all the good and all the prosperity I provide for it.”</i></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">we want you to come alongside us and love our city. whether it’s a vacation, a business trip, or you want to uproot and move here.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">here are some strong values in our city:</h3>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">tolerance. people tolerate your views and values which makes most open to hearing your beliefs and how you do life.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">less is more. eliminating waste, caring for the environment, reusing and composting are actions that lead to “less is more” philosophy.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">community. urban farms, adult kickball teams, co-ops, and neighborhood block parties are just a few ways people link up and form communities.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">giving back. people care for the homeless. corporations and start-ups take days off to clean the streets together. a pair of socks for the needy is admission to events.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">diversity. the culture is a melting pot. you see it costco, on the school yard, and street corner. languages fly around as the various species of birds. collectively, the city thrives because of this value.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">local sells. few chain restaurants and bookstores thrive in the city. people rally and support their own who rise up and begin their own thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">here are some discovered facts about our city:</h3>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">summer is the coldest</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">an sf parking ticket = the price of a night at the hyatt hotel</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">rent is expensive, but if you count all the parks, playgrounds, views, and experiences, you factor into the price!</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">fisherman’s wharf is for tourists only. you need only go once.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">college football is not the main event on fall saturdays.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">layering is key. never leave without a jacket (and I’d add a scarf for added warmth)</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">kids don’t go to school according to where they live, but rather the family lists the top 7 public schools and the choice is assigned through a lottery system. it’s a science and requires a special degree to understand. and we’re a public school family.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">entertainment is provided free of charge on any public transportation.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">food. there’s nothing like it here.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">the city finds any reason to celebrate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">the list is always growing as we become more san franciscan. here’s what we love:</h3>\r\n<h4 style="text-align: center;">kid-friendly restaurants</h4>\r\n<p

style="text-align: center;">renting bikes from sports basement in the presidio/crissy field + biking to the base of the Golden Gate Bridge + picnic lunch + burying feet in the warm sand afraid to feel the cold sting of the bay waters</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">farmer’s market (ferry building on tuesdays, thursdays, and saturdays) but most neighborhoods have swell ones, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">a visitor’s guide to san francisco:</h3>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">research the neighborhoods. of the 14, each has a unique vibe and atmosphere. seriously, if you want what the common tourist gets, then you’ll be fine at union square, fisherman’s wharf and ghirardelli square. don’t get me wrong, all great places, along with the golden gate bridge and at&amp;t park. but to truly get a feel for the place we call home, set off for a neighborhood.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">the same goes for food. if you look hard enough, you’ll find a restaurant you’ve heard of and is familiar. but i challenge you. try a new place. but always check the reviews. they’re not all 5 stars...though we’ve only had one bad experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style="text-align: center;"><b>should I rent a car?</b></h4>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">i wouldn’t. hotels charge for overnight parking and anywhere you drive, you’ll pay to park. public transit can get you almost anywhere you want to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style="text-align: center;"><b>what’s the difference between MUNI and BART?</b></h4>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">MUNI is the train and bus system in the city of san francisco.

Francisco</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">tony bennett says “he left his heart in san francisco.” i feel as if we got the better deal...our hearts <i>are</i> in san francisco.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">we love our city. it’s a growing, exploring love. it’s birthed out of our desire to claim jeremiah 33.9:</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><i>“and this city shall be to Me a name of joy, a praise and a glory before all the nations of the earth who shall hear of all the good I do for them. they shall fear and tremble because of all the good and all the prosperity I provide for it.”</i></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">we want you to come alongside us and love our city. whether it’s a vacation, a business trip, or you want to uproot and move here.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">here are some strong values in our city:</h3>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">tolerance. people tolerate your views and values which makes most open to hearing your beliefs and how you do life.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">less is more. eliminating waste, caring for the environment, reusing and composting are actions that lead to “less is more” philosophy.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">community. urban farms, adult kickball teams, co-ops, and neighborhood block parties are just a few ways people link up and form communities.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">giving back. people care for the homeless. corporations and start-ups take days off to clean the streets together. a pair of socks for the needy is admission to events.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">diversity. the culture is a melting pot. you see it costco, on the school yard, and street corner. languages fly around as the various species of birds. collectively, the city thrives because of this value.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">local sells. few chain restaurants and bookstores thrive in the city. people rally and support their own who rise up and begin their own thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">here are some discovered facts about our city:</h3>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">summer is the coldest</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">an sf parking ticket = the price of a night at the hyatt hotel</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">rent is expensive, but if you count all the parks, playgrounds, views, and experiences, you factor into the price!</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">fisherman’s wharf is for tourists only. you need only go once.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">college football is not the main event on fall saturdays.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">layering is key. never leave without a jacket (and I’d add a scarf for added warmth)</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">kids don’t go to school according to where they live, but rather the family lists the top 7 public schools and the choice is assigned through a lottery system. it’s a science and requires a special degree to understand. and we’re a public school family.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">entertainment is provided free of charge on any public transportation.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">food. there’s nothing like it here.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">the city finds any reason to celebrate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3

Francisco</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">tony bennett says “he left his heart in san francisco.” i feel as if we got the better deal...our hearts <i>are</i> in san francisco.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">we love our city. it’s a growing, exploring love. it’s birthed out of our desire to claim jeremiah 33.9:</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><i>“and this city shall be to Me a name of joy, a praise and a glory before all the nations of the earth who shall hear of all the good I do for them. they shall fear and tremble because of all the good and all the prosperity I provide for it.”</i></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">we want you to come alongside us and love our city. whether it’s a vacation, a business trip, or you want to uproot and move here.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">here are some strong values in our city:</h3>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">tolerance. people tolerate your views and values which makes most open to hearing your beliefs and how you do life.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">less is more. eliminating waste, caring for the environment, reusing and composting are actions that lead to “less is more” philosophy.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">community. urban farms, adult kickball teams, co-ops, and neighborhood block parties are just a few ways people link up and form communities.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">giving back. people care for the homeless. corporations and start-ups take days off to clean the streets together. a pair of socks for the needy is admission to events.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">diversity. the culture is a melting pot. you see it costco, on the school yard, and street corner. languages fly around as the various species of birds. collectively, the city thrives because of this value.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">local sells. few chain restaurants and bookstores thrive in the city. people rally and support their own who rise up and begin their own thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">here are some discovered facts about our city:</h3>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">summer is the coldest</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">an sf parking ticket = the price of a night at the hyatt hotel</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">rent is expensive, but if you count all the parks, playgrounds, views, and experiences, you factor into the price!</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">fisherman’s wharf is for tourists only. you need only go once.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">college football is not the main event on fall saturdays.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">layering is key. never leave without a jacket (and I’d add a scarf for added warmth)</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">kids don’t go to school according to where they live, but rather the family lists the top 7 public schools and the choice is assigned through a lottery system. it’s a science and requires a special degree to understand. and we’re a public school family.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">entertainment is provided free of charge on any public transportation.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">food. there’s nothing like it here.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">the city finds any reason to celebrate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">the list is always growing as we become more san franciscan. here’s what we love:</h3>\r\n<h4 style="text-align: center;">kid-friendly restaurants</h4>\r\n<p

style="text-align: center;">renting bikes from sports basement in the presidio/crissy field + biking to the base of the Golden Gate Bridge + picnic lunch + burying feet in the warm sand afraid to feel the cold sting of the bay waters</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">farmer’s market (ferry building on tuesdays, thursdays, and saturdays) but most neighborhoods have swell ones, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">a visitor’s guide to san francisco:</h3>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">research the neighborhoods. of the 14, each has a unique vibe and atmosphere. seriously, if you want what the common tourist gets, then you’ll be fine at union square, fisherman’s wharf and ghirardelli square. don’t get me wrong, all great places, along with the golden gate bridge and at&amp;t park. but to truly get a feel for the place we call home, set off for a neighborhood.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">the same goes for food. if you look hard enough, you’ll find a restaurant you’ve heard of and is familiar. but i challenge you. try a new place. but always check the reviews. they’re not all 5 stars...though we’ve only had one bad experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style="text-align: center;"><b>should I rent a car?</b></h4>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">i wouldn’t. hotels charge for overnight parking and anywhere you drive, you’ll pay to park. public transit can get you almost anywhere you want to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style="text-align: center;"><b>what’s the difference between MUNI and BART?</b></h4>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">MUNI is the train and bus system in the city of san francisco. If it’s a number, then it’s a bus.

Francisco</h2>\n<p style="text-align: center;">tony bennett says “he left his heart in san francisco.” i feel as if we got the better deal...our hearts <i>are</i> in san francisco.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">we love our city. it’s a growing, exploring love. it’s birthed out of our desire to claim jeremiah 33.9:</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><i>“and this city shall be to Me a name of joy, a praise and a glory before all the nations of the earth who shall hear of all the good I do for them. they shall fear and tremble because of all the good and all the prosperity I provide for it.”</i></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">we want you to come alongside us and love our city. whether it’s a vacation, a business trip, or you want to uproot and move here.</p>\n\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">here are some strong values in our city:</h3>\n<p style="text-align: center;">tolerance. people tolerate your views and values which makes most open to hearing your beliefs and how you do life.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">less is more. eliminating waste, caring for the environment, reusing and composting are actions that lead to “less is more” philosophy.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">community. urban farms, adult kickball teams, co-ops, and neighborhood block parties are just a few ways people link up and form communities.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">giving back. people care for the homeless. corporations and start-ups take days off to clean the streets together. a pair of socks for the needy is admission to events.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">diversity. the culture is a melting pot. you see it costco, on the school yard, and street corner. languages fly around as the various species of birds. collectively, the city thrives because of this value.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">local sells. few chain restaurants and bookstores thrive in the city. people rally and support their own who rise up and begin their own thing.</p>\n\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">here are some discovered facts about our city:</h3>\n<p style="text-align: center;">summer is the coldest</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">an sf parking ticket = the price of a night at the hyatt hotel</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">rent is expensive, but if you count all the parks, playgrounds, views, and experiences, you factor into the price!</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">fisherman’s wharf is for tourists only. you need only go once.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">college football is not the main event on fall saturdays.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">layering is key. never leave without a jacket (and I’d add a scarf for added warmth)</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">kids don’t go to school according to where they live, but rather the family lists the top 7 public schools and the choice is assigned through a lottery system. it’s a science and requires a special degree to understand. and we’re a public school family.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">entertainment is provided free of charge on any public transportation.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">food. there’s nothing like it here.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">the city finds any reason to celebrate.</p>\n\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">the list is always growing as we become more san franciscan. here’s what we love:</h3>\n<h4 style="text-align: center;">kid-friendly restaurants</h4>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://toasteatery.com" target="_blank">toast on 24th street</a></p>\n<p

style="text-align: center;">renting bikes from sports basement in the presidio/crissy field + biking to the base of the Golden Gate Bridge + picnic lunch + burying feet in the warm sand afraid to feel the cold sting of the bay waters</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">farmer’s market (ferry building on tuesdays, thursdays, and saturdays) but most neighborhoods have swell ones, too.</p>\n\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">a visitor’s guide to san francisco:</h3>\n<p style="text-align: center;">research the neighborhoods. of the 14, each has a unique vibe and atmosphere. seriously, if you want what the common tourist gets, then you’ll be fine at union square, fisherman’s wharf and ghirardelli square. don’t get me wrong, all great places, along with the golden gate bridge and at&amp;t park. but to truly get a feel for the place we call home, set off for a neighborhood.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">the same goes for food. if you look hard enough, you’ll find a restaurant you’ve heard of and is familiar. but i challenge you. try a new place. but always check the reviews. they’re not all 5 stars...though we’ve only had one bad experience.</p>\n\n<h4 style="text-align: center;"><b>should I rent a car?</b></h4>\n<p style="text-align: center;">i wouldn’t. hotels charge for overnight parking and anywhere you drive, you’ll pay to park. public transit can get you almost anywhere you want to go.</p>\n\n<h4 style="text-align: center;"><b>what’s the difference between MUNI and BART?</b></h4>\n<p style="text-align: center;">MUNI is the train and bus system in the city of san francisco. If it’s a number, then it’s a bus. If it’s a letter, then it’s a train.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">BART is transit around the bay area. you can take this from the airport into the city.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">just to throw a curveball, there’s the CalTrain. it has only one SF location and heads south of the city with great stops like palo alto, stanford, and burlingame.</p>\n\n<h4 style="text-align: center;"><b>should we bring our kids?</b></h4>\n<p style="text-align: center;">that depends. have you and your spouse had a getaway recently? if not, just the two of you! it’s a romantic city with quaint european restaurants in north beach (little italy) and cole valley. walks along the bay come decorated with lights at night and sweeping views by day. linger at coffee shops, explore golden gate park, or escape to muir woods.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">yet...this is definitely a city for the kids!</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://creativity.org">children’s creativity museum</a></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://sfzoo.org" target="_blank">san francisco zoo</a></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://calacademy.org" target="_blank">california academy of sciences</a></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://waltdisney.org" target="_blank">walt disney museum</a></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://mitchellsicecream.com" target="_blank">mitchell’s ice cream </a></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://demo.inspiredcauses.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_1135.jpg"><img alt="IMG_1135" src="http://demo.inspiredcauses.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_1135-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/sf/ballpark/index.jsp" target="_blank">AT&amp;T Park (SF Giants)</a></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://houseofair.com" target="_blank">house of air</a></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://demo.inspiredcauses.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_2801.jpg"><img alt="IMG_2801" src="http://demo.inspiredcauses.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_2801-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">and the pacific ocean is always free!</p>\n\n<h4 style="text-align: center;"><b>what must i pack?</b></h4>\n<p style="text-align: center;">good walking shoes</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">layers (jacket, scarf, regardless the season)</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">an idea of what you want to see (the city can overwhelm a first timer; know what you want to see)</p>\n\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">where should we stay?</h3>\n<p style="text-align: center;">you''ll pay more staying downtown, in the heart of the city, but pay less in transportation that way.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">it''s cheaper to stay down by the airport or in daly city, but you''ll spend time and money transiting in.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">our mission teams often stay at <a href="http://thepickwickhotel.com" target="_blank">the pickwick hotel</a> which is on 5th street between mission and market.</p>', 'san francisco', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '632-autosave', '', '', '2013-02-09 18:59:09', '2013-02-10 02:59:09', '', 632, 'http://demo.inspiredcauses.com/632-autosave/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Asked 10 women to commit to pray for our family, for me. [I had no idea that 3 years later, i’d be emailing them still with requests and they’d still be committed to praying for us.]\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>9.09</h3>\nMade contact with a public school teacher in San Francisco. We’re quite different. I’m a pastor’s wife. She’s a Jewish lesbian. Her insight into the schools was so helpful. She was happy to know we wanted to move our family to the city and make a difference in a public school.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>2.05.10</h3>\nSpent a few days learning from church planters in New York City.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>week of 3.22.10</h3>\nSorted through clothes in closet and books on bookshelves. Donate. Consign. Give away.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>4.10</h3>\nAttended church planting conference with our staff.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<i>“There comes a time in every person’s life when they are given a unique opportunity to discover the purpose for which they are born. It is their moment of destiny and if they seize it, it is their finest hour.”</i>\n\n<i>Sir Winston Churchill</i>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>week of 4.6.10</h3>\nBoxed up personal baby toys and marked Epic Church nursery.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>week of 4.20.10</h3>\nPacked up box for mom and dad. Cross-stitched picture. Boy’s baby items. [might not have a place to store this in San Francisco]\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>5.1.10</h3>\nBegan to panic. If we’re giving up church programming, who’s gonna teach our kids? We don’t even start weekly services for at least ten more months. Started to write “hero boot camp” curriculum. That’s a fun idea.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>5.29.10</h3>\nI’ve been physically sick for a few days. We’ve said our good byes and today me and the boys fly to San Francisco. My best friend is helping us move. Ben and a few friends drove out a few days ago. Here goes...\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>6.06.10</h3>\nFirst launch team meeting in our apartment.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>7.25.10</h3>\nWe’re meeting people. Having people into our apartment. Sharing our story of why we are here. We’re venturing out and learning new things. Grateful we’re doing this together as a family. Reminded today we aren’t out here alone.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI looked back in my journal this morning. Just a few years ago I wrote, “As best as I can describe it, we held hands, looked at each other, and stepped figuratively off the cliff into the great unknown of faith.”\n\nAnd it’s been one of the best decisions ever made.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;', 'epic', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '684-revision', '', '', '2013-02-09 22:35:37', '2013-02-10 06:35:37', '', 684, 'http://demo.inspiredcauses.com/684-revision/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

I did notice a public parking garage that charged $7.50 per hour and knew we could do better than that. So we settled in between two cars on the street and filled the meter with $3.50 in coins to give us a glorious one hour of parking. </div><div>Now, I''ve lived in the city LONG enough to know that you read the signs around you and remember the cross streets of where you parked. So I noticed Grant and Sutter Streets and that I only had one hour. I also noticed the signs up on the street posts that said the times and days for street cleaning and knew we were good there. </div><div>WHAT I didn''t notice were the stickers down the post of the meter that said "commercial loading zone" and a phone number hotline in case your car is towed. </div><div>So we looked closely at our watches and enjoyed the next 54 minutes in Chinatown!</div><div><br></div><div>To my regurgitating stomach and shocked eyes, the van was NOT where we left it!

The city that has captured my heart, my attention, and my devotion. This time, we took along 28 others, including Epic staff and representatives from 11 churches from Illinois, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, Alabama, and Louisiana. Within two days, we visited our target area, the area of the city where we desire to start a church. Though Mission Bay is under reconstruction, there are still 100,000 people in the area with projections that over 300,000 people will be living there in a matter of a few years. UCSF at Mission Bay, Old Navy headquarters, Women''s and Children''s Cancer Research Hospital, regenerative medicine research, and tech-driven businesses are already there or are moving in. We, as a church, want to grow with the community. As the community forms its own identity, we want to be there to serve and show the love of Christ. We want to partner with the city of San Francisco and the people to make the city a better place. <br><br><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/SoVX6jZwOjI/AAAAAAAAAz8/UdqV7peu6zg/s1600-h/DSC00654.JPG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/SoVX6jZwOjI/AAAAAAAAAz8/UdqV7peu6zg/s320/DSC00654.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><br><br><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/SoVX70waurI/AAAAAAAAA0M/FGpZzRQyi6I/s1600-h/DSC00691.JPG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/SoVX70waurI/AAAAAAAAA0M/FGpZzRQyi6I/s320/DSC00691.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><br><br>I loved seeing the Mission Creek Park that have been formed in Mission Bay.

Pastors came from churches of different sizes and different styles and left with the same heart after they saw the same great need. I truly believe that everyone was Kingdom focused as they saw a city of life and hope. We can''t wait to see all that God wants to accomplish in and through the partnerships with these 11 churches. And as far as our family, we are glad to return home and see our boys and take them back to the city soon. We see them as a huge part of this as well.

Some worship in hotels like us, some worship in secret, and some worship in buildings with steeples.

It was a moment I will never forget as 100 people from the Epic community gathered at Ben and Lindsey''s apartment pool to witness our church''s first baptism. 3 young ladies made their faith public as they were baptized before their parents, family, and friends. I loved that as we applauded, by-standers joined in the clapping. I love that we surrounded a pool and gave our undivided attention to those around us and those being baptized. I love that God gave us the most sunny day for the occasion. I love that we <i>get</i> to improvise; that we <i>get</i> to think unconventionally. I love that our church community responds with enthusiasm. <div>It wasn''t just an evening for baptism, but of fellowship. With the help of our small groups, Uche, one of our volunteers, organized the food, cooking, and greeting. She exemplified a servant on so many levels. She complimented each person that was helping her out. </div><div>As a mom, I was fulfilled to see the kids form community outside of their usual interaction at church. I took a minute to look around the tables, to look at those gathered at the grill and those soaking in the last bit of sun at the pool. Everyone engaged in conversation. Laughter. Learning new names. Asian. African. Preschooler. Art student. Single mom. Aging parents. A clump of girls exchanging phone numbers and email addresses as they discover community together for the first time. Parents chatting with other parents - with one eye on the kids. Young professionals already making the next weekend plans together. </div><div><br></div><div>What a display.

Epic is proud to partner with this school to provide supplies for teachers who are otherwise using their own money. People gave generously.</div><div><br></div><div>Ben shared the story of Zacchaeus from the book of Luke. Zacchaeus not only didn''t do life with others, but took life from others as he charged too much for taxes in his day. Obviously, he didn''t have many friends. Zacchaeus became desperate as he climbed the tree to seek Jesus. The beautiful part of the story is that Jesus was seeking out Zacchaeus and is seeking us out today. We all have a little bit of Zacchaeus in us. Think about it...we don''t teach our kids to be selfish! But a transformation took place in the life of Zacchaeus. Ben shared that he went from accruing wealth at the expense of others to serving others at the expense of himself.  Ben challenged us that life is meant to be shared! How will I share my life with others this week!? For Sunday was so much fun in sharing life with new friends and starting a new church in this city!</div><div><br></div><div>These stories made possible by God''s goodness!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>', 'Epic Stories of Sharing Life', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '195-revision', '', '', '2010-10-12 23:40:00', '2010-10-12 23:40:00', '', 195, 'http://localhost:8888/195-revision/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

You''ve been following our three boys. Yes, I take them on adventures in the city, but they are counting down the days til Epic Kids gets underway! This is where Sam will sing songs and color sheets and hear weekly how much he is loved by our church family and by God. Asher will feel safe and welcomed in his room as he builds with blocks on a clean and colorful rug. Elijah will feel like a big kid watching the lesson on a TV/DVD before he goes to a small group where he learns how to apply it to his life. And this is just our three! We want more kids and their families to experience Epic Kids!</span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>This is an investment. This is a gift. This provides Epic Church with the resources to help make Epic Kids a success.

Instead, we must engage in other’s lives and hear their stories and learn their needs, whether we agree with their lifestyle or not. </span></span><span><br></span><ol></ol><p><span>We were asked in a small group session, “in what ways do i disqualify myself from being a church planter’s wife?” I answer honestly with: a lack of education beyond a college degree, white girl, southern background and accent. We were then asked to draw a circle of concern. What in my new neighborhood concerns me? Then we were asked to draw a circle of influence. What in my circle of concern can I have influence in?  “You usually can’t do something about everything you’re concerned about.”      B.

It was such a warm treat to be in a home rather than a hotel and to enjoy the family''s hospitality. Clay continues to minister in the city as Lyn builds relationships with women and takes care of home. They are a remarkable family and we gleaned much insight into raising a family in the city. Lyn was authentic as she honestly said it''s hard, but worth it! </span></div><div><span><br></span></div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/S222sjGj0qI/AAAAAAAABHg/jVP8R19PSl8/s1600-h/DSC01548.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/S222sjGj0qI/AAAAAAAABHg/jVP8R19PSl8/s320/DSC01548.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>The Cook family recommended Crumbs Bakery for a delicious cupcake before traveling to Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

He has pastored in NYC for years and challenges his congregation to live out the Gospel for the good of the city.

Walking the streets of NYC and talking at every meal and with every cup of coffee, the four of us were constantly debriefing what we saw and experienced. I was reminded on this trip how gifted Ben is as a leader and visionary. We spent time with church planters that are at least 4 years into it. It was overwhelming to me at times to think of how our church would get from a vision on paper to a building to a collective group of people. I am confident in what God has placed in Ben and am eager to one day have future church planters come and visit Epic Church San Francisco and see what God has done.</span></div></div>', 'An EPIC moment in NYC', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '266-revision', '', '', '2010-02-06 18:33:00', '2010-02-06 18:33:00', '', 266, 'http://localhost:8888/266-revision/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

I had the privilege of mentoring Meagan in a small group while she was in high school. She''s now about to finish up her time at LSU and her life amazes me at how reflective it is of Christ. Her sweet spirit and godly leadership are attractive. Staying up late talking and listening and catching up, I can only dream of how God is going to use her in this world to make a powerful difference. She certainly leaves a mark everywhere she has been thus far and that mark is in the name of Christ Jesus. <div>Though God has richly blessed me with three boys to raise, I am thankful for ''daughter moments'' like this, when I get to curl up with a blanket and sit beside a girl and finish each other''s sentences and spur one another on....God is so gracious to bless me with these gifts along the way. And as for Meagan, I have told her that I have a front row seat - watching her on the stage of life as she plays a major role in God''s work here on earth! </div><div><br><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/S19HUH1aH0I/AAAAAAAABGg/e0FZ22XaT2w/s1600-h/DSC01488.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/S19HUH1aH0I/AAAAAAAABGg/e0FZ22XaT2w/s320/DSC01488.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><br></div>', 'An EPIC moment', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '269-revision', '', '', '2010-01-26 19:47:00', '2010-01-26 19:47:00', '', 269, 'http://localhost:8888/269-revision/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Some worship in hotels like us, some worship in secret, and some worship in buildings with steeples. The way we worship today will look quite different from our church, but I promise you that you’ll smile just being there and it will be a highlight of your day.

I wanted to document this special occasion on our blog and share it with you if you haven''t seen it yet.<br><br>The beauty of our church start is we have to improvise in many scenarios; one being baptism celebrations. It was a moment I will never forget as 100 people from the Epic community gathered at Ben and Lindsey''s apartment pool to witness our church''s first baptism. 3 young ladies made their faith public as they were baptized before their parents, family, and friends. I loved that as we applauded, by-standers joined in the clapping. I love that we surrounded a pool and gave our undivided attention to those around us and those being baptized. I love that God gave us the most sunny day for the occasion. I love that we <i>get</i> to improvise; that we <i>get</i> to think unconventionally. I love that our church community responds with enthusiasm. <div>It wasn''t just an evening for baptism, but of fellowship.

Mary shares Alabama connections with us and graciously volunteered to help with Epic Kids check-in.</div><div><br></div><div>At least a dozen friends from the city who are connected at other churches/ministries came to show their support. Just making eye contact, receiving a head shake, or embracing with a hug, confirmed their encouragement.</div><div><br></div><div>Carol came at the very end and said she was grateful a church is nearby her apartment. Her husband handed her the invite he had received on the street and encouraged her to go.

I expressed that she was a part of it all!</div><div><br></div><div>D. has lived in the city for over a year and hasn''t found a church quite like the one she went to in Dallas. She told Ben that she felt at home at Epic.</div><div><br></div><div>Whitney and Jon who are new to the city and were very active in their home church in Michigan showed up with coffee for the set-up team at 6 am. They were amazing servants the whole day!</div><div><br></div><div>2 pastor''s wives from 2 of our partnering CA churches came to work. They brought their kids along, leaving their husbands back at their home churches. Karen''s church (Crossroads in Fremont) helped start Staci''s church (South Bay in Santa Clara).

Ben is privileged to enjoy coffee and lunch with a few of them this week. Some are interested in joining our launch team.</div><div><br></div><div>Two women wrote Ben emails before the preview service sharing their gratitude and perfect timing of receiving the postcard in the mail. Both attended. One commented after the service at how well prepared and thought out the service and set up was. She appreciated the warm welcome she received. </div><div><br></div><div>One person wrote on their comment card that they were interested in becoming a Christian. </div><div><br></div><div>The offering taken up at the end of the service was 100% given to Bessie Carmichael School in our neighborhood. Epic is proud to partner with this school to provide supplies for teachers who are otherwise using their own money. People gave generously.</div><div><br></div><div>Ben shared the story of Zacchaeus from the book of Luke. Zacchaeus not only didn''t do life with others, but took life from others as he charged too much for taxes in his day. Obviously, he didn''t have many friends. Zacchaeus became desperate as he climbed the tree to seek Jesus. The beautiful part of the story is that Jesus was seeking out Zacchaeus and is seeking us out today. We all have a little bit of Zacchaeus in us. Think about it...we don''t teach our kids to be selfish! But a transformation took place in the life of Zacchaeus. Ben shared that he went from accruing wealth at the expense of others to serving others at the expense of himself.  Ben challenged us that life is meant to be shared! How will I share my life with others this week!? For Sunday was so much fun in sharing life with new friends and starting a new church in this city!</div><div><br></div><div>These stories made possible by God''s goodness!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>', 'Epic Stories of Sharing Life', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '195-revision-2', '', '', '2013-02-11 08:05:52', '2013-02-11 16:05:52', '', 195, 'http://localhost:8888/195-revision-2/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Christians must have empathy towards others. We are not called up put up with something and turn our back because there’s nothing we can do. Instead, we must engage in other’s lives and hear their stories and learn their needs, whether we agree with their lifestyle or not. </span></span><span><br></span><ol></ol><p><span>We were asked in a small group session, “in what ways do i disqualify myself from being a church planter’s wife?” I answer honestly with: a lack of education beyond a college degree, white girl, southern background and accent. We were then asked to draw a circle of concern. What in my new neighborhood concerns me? Then we were asked to draw a circle of influence. What in my circle of concern can I have influence in?  “You usually can’t do something about everything you’re concerned about.”      B. Salter-McNeil</span><span><span></span></span></p><ol></ol><p><span>“There comes a time in every person’s life when they are given a unique opportunity to discover the purpose for which they are born. It is their moment of destiny and if they seize it, it is their finest hour.”    Sir Winston Churchill (obviously not present at conference, but quoted!)</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><span><span>It matters WHO you love like not WHO you look like.   S. Claiborne</span></span></div><div><span><span><span><br></span></span></span><span><span>“Some need rescuing from the ghetto and some need rescuing from the cul-de-sac.”   S.

I personally appreciate his wife''s comments in an article that NYC was the best place to raise her three boys. </span></div><div><span><br></span></div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/S222sGNpdgI/AAAAAAAABHY/Qj-EH4FMVgc/s1600-h/DSC01554.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/S222sGNpdgI/AAAAAAAABHY/Qj-EH4FMVgc/s320/DSC01554.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Finally, we taxied down to the Lower East Side and scurried to make it to the 7 pm service at Apostles Church, where JR Vassar pastors. We enjoyed lunch with JR on Friday where we got to ask lots of questions and hear about his vision for the city and the church. This service was in an Episcopal Church full of beauty and reverence. It was exciting to see many young professionals in the service. </span></div><div><span><br></span></div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/S222rpGZGAI/AAAAAAAABHQ/HPb4T0oKKyg/s1600-h/DSC01553.JPG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/S222rpGZGAI/AAAAAAAABHQ/HPb4T0oKKyg/s320/DSC01553.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><div><span>We continue to learn and pray as we are just a few months from moving to San Francisco. Walking the streets of NYC and talking at every meal and with every cup of coffee, the four of us were constantly debriefing what we saw and experienced. I was reminded on this trip how gifted Ben is as a leader and visionary. We spent time with church planters that are at least 4 years into it. It was overwhelming to me at times to think of how our church would get from a vision on paper to a building to a collective group of people. I am confident in what God has placed in Ben and am eager to one day have future church planters come and visit Epic Church San Francisco and see what God has done.</span></div></div>', 'An EPIC moment in NYC', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '266-revision-2', '', '', '2013-02-11 08:05:53', '2013-02-11 16:05:53', '', 266, 'http://localhost:8888/266-revision-2/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Once again, I am amazed to hear the stories of how God has gotten us to this point and how others want to come alongside us in this vision. Lindsey Lee was there to share her story as well.

I had the privilege of mentoring Meagan in a small group while she was in high school. She''s now about to finish up her time at LSU and her life amazes me at how reflective it is of Christ. Her sweet spirit and godly leadership are attractive. Staying up late talking and listening and catching up, I can only dream of how God is going to use her in this world to make a powerful difference. She certainly leaves a mark everywhere she has been thus far and that mark is in the name of Christ Jesus. <div>Though God has richly blessed me with three boys to raise, I am thankful for ''daughter moments'' like this, when I get to curl up with a blanket and sit beside a girl and finish each other''s sentences and spur one another on....God is so gracious to bless me with these gifts along the way. And as for Meagan, I have told her that I have a front row seat - watching her on the stage of life as she plays a major role in God''s work here on earth! </div><div><br><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/S19HUH1aH0I/AAAAAAAABGg/e0FZ22XaT2w/s1600-h/DSC01488.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PUx1QCmVNq8/S19HUH1aH0I/AAAAAAAABGg/e0FZ22XaT2w/s320/DSC01488.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><br></div>', 'An EPIC moment', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '269-revision-2', '', '', '2013-02-11 08:05:53', '2013-02-11 16:05:53', '', 269, 'http://localhost:8888/269-revision-2/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Eleven year old Lukaya spoke these words to me as we were leaving the market today. Hope is what I saw in her beautiful eyes. A second chance may be coming her way. Redemption is hers in the Lord. She is far away from her original tribe in the Northern part of Ghana. Someone came through their village and offered a better way of life in Accra, the capital city. Lukaya''s story is like countless others. She sleeps on a bench every night. She has no parents. And selling food out of a bowl on her head is how she gets enough to survive. We have met a sea of beautiful faces this week. Those images are constantly running through my mind and heart in continual prayer. I don''t understand how things get this bad. I hate the evil in the world, especially toward those who are the most vulnerable. But I do know this. The Lord sees them. He knows their name. He loves them more than we can imagine. </span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">\r\n</span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">\r\n</span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">My hope is that the Lord will lead us to the girls He has picked out for us already.

Eleven year old Lukaya spoke these words to me as we were leaving the market today. Hope is what I saw in her beautiful eyes. A second chance may be coming her way. Redemption is hers in the Lord. She is far away from her original tribe in the Northern part of Ghana. Someone came through their village and offered a better way of life in Accra, the capital city. Lukaya''s story is like countless others. She sleeps on a bench every night. She has no parents. And selling food out of a bowl on her head is how she gets enough to survive. We have met a sea of beautiful faces this week. Those images are constantly running through my mind and heart in continual prayer. I don''t understand how things get this bad. I hate the evil in the world, especially toward those who are the most vulnerable. But I do know this. The Lord sees them. He knows their name. He loves them more than we can imagine. </span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">\n</span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">\n</span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">My hope is that the Lord will lead us to the girls He has picked out for us already.

I can sense it when he’s preaching. I can hear it in his voice when he shares with me about this series of Esther taking risks. The pieces are coming together tonight as he asked me to pray about church planting. With a deep breath and a wavering trust, I say, “I’ll do that. I’ll pray. Give me a few days.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">We’ve got it really good. A home in a safe neighborhood in the midwest. A mentor, pastor, who pours daily into Ben. Teaching pastor at a strong missional church. Great public school. Children involved in solid church programs. Friends. Driving distance to family. Season tickets to Silver Dollar City!</p>\n\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">11.20.08</h3>\n<p style="text-align: center;">We’re not promised this good life here on earth. But we are promised that He will never leave us. That He goes before us. As a young girl, I had already told God that I’d go anywhere. Africa was more on the radar than an urban setting in North America! Ben and I talked about the ‘non-negotiables’ tonight. What we could sacrifice and what we wouldn’t. We could give up being a 2 car family, owning a home, living somewhat close to family. We wouldn’t sacrifice our marriage, our children’s best interests or their education. As best as I can describe it, we held hands, looked at each other, and stepped off the cliff into the great unknown of this faith journey into church planting.</p>\n\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">11.30.08</h3>\n<p style="text-align: center;">We wrote a 50 Day Prayer Guide today for the 6 of us who will make a trip to San Francisco in January.</p>\n\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">12.01.08</h3>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DH000098.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-700 aligncenter" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DH000098-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><i>“No distrust made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God, fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised.” Romans 4.20-21</i></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><i>\n“You are my witnesses,” declares the LORD, “and my servant whom I have chosen, that you may know and believe me and understand that I am he. Before me no god was formed, nor shall there be any after me. I, I am the LORD, and besides me there is no savior.” Isaiah 43.10-11</i></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">We have been called to the task. There is peace in our hearts. As we journey to what we perceive as “ moving day,” “launch” and whatever comes, He wants to grow and prepare us. It is a process. Although we grow anxious, we couldn’t handle it all at one time. We must declare there is only One God who has saved us!</p>\n\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">1.21.09</h3>\n<p style="text-align: center;">Made our initial trip to San Francisco. Certain it is the city and not the suburbs. Wow, this place is big. It’s rainy. Where are the playgrounds for our kids? There’s concrete everywhere. Where will we live? Will I really carry my groceries out of the store, down the sidewalk, across the street, and into our home? What will church look like here? I’ve got so many questions.</p>\n\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">7.13.09</h3>\n<p style="text-align: center;">Told Ben how overwhelmed I am with research, information, and the process.

style="text-align: center;">we love our city. it’s a growing, exploring love. it’s birthed out of our desire to claim jeremiah 33.9:</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><i>“and this city shall be to Me a name of joy, a praise and a glory before all the nations of the earth who shall hear of all the good I do for them. they shall fear and tremble because of all the good and all the prosperity I

here.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">here are some strong values in our city:</h3>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">tolerance. people tolerate your views and values which makes most open to hearing your beliefs and how you do life.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">less is more. eliminating waste, caring for the environment, reusing and composting are actions that lead to “less is more” philosophy.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">community. urban farms, adult kickball teams, co-ops, and neighborhood block parties are just a few ways people link up and form communities.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">giving back. people care for the homeless. corporations and start-ups take days off to clean the streets together. a pair of socks for the needy is admission to events.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">diversity. the culture is a melting pot. you see it costco, on the school yard, and street corner. languages fly around as the various species of birds. collectively, the city thrives because of this value.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">local sells. few chain restaurants and bookstores thrive in the city. people rally and support their own who rise up and begin their own thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">here are some discovered facts about our city:</h3>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">summer is the coldest</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">an sf parking ticket = the price of a night at the hyatt hotel</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">rent is expensive, but if you count all the parks, playgrounds, views, and experiences, you factor into the price!</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">fisherman’s wharf is for tourists only. you need only go once.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">college football is not the main event on fall saturdays.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">layering is key. never leave without a jacket (and I’d add a scarf for added warmth)</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">kids don’t go to school according to where they live, but rather the family lists the top 7 public schools and the choice is assigned through a lottery system. it’s a science and requires a special degree to understand. and we’re a public school family.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">entertainment is provided free of charge on any public transportation.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">food. there’s nothing like it here.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">the city finds any reason to celebrate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3

too.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">a visitor’s guide to san francisco:</h3>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">research the neighborhoods. of the 14, each has a unique vibe and atmosphere. seriously, if you want what the common tourist gets, then you’ll be fine at union square, fisherman’s wharf and ghirardelli square. don’t get me wrong, all great places, along with the golden gate bridge and at&amp;t park. but to truly get a feel for the place we call home, set off for a neighborhood.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">the same goes for food. if you look hard enough, you’ll find a restaurant you’ve heard of and is familiar. but i challenge you. try a new place. but always check the reviews. they’re not all 5 stars...though we’ve only had one bad experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style="text-align: center;"><b>should I rent a car?</b></h4>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">i wouldn’t. hotels charge for overnight parking and anywhere you drive, you’ll pay to park. public transit can get you almost anywhere you want to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style="text-align: center;"><b>what’s the difference between MUNI and BART?</b></h4>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">MUNI is the train and bus system in the city of san francisco. If it’s a number, then it’s a bus. If it’s a letter, then it’s a train.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">BART is transit around the bay area. you can take this from the airport into the city.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">just to throw a curveball, there’s the CalTrain. it has only one SF location and heads south of the city with great stops like palo alto, stanford, and burlingame.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style="text-align: center;"><b>should we bring our kids?</b></h4>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">that depends. have you and your spouse had a getaway recently? if not, just the two of you! it’s a romantic city with quaint european restaurants in north beach (little italy) and cole valley. walks along the bay come decorated with lights at night and sweeping views by day. linger at coffee shops, explore golden gate park, or escape to muir woods.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">yet...this is definitely a city for the kids!</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://creativity.org">children’s creativity museum</a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://sfzoo.org" target="_blank">san francisco zoo</a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://calacademy.org" target="_blank">california academy of sciences</a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://waltdisney.org" target="_blank">walt disney museum</a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://mitchellsicecream.com" target="_blank">mitchell’s ice cream </a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://demo.inspiredcauses.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_1135.jpg"><img alt="IMG_1135" src="http://demo.inspiredcauses.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_1135-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/sf/ballpark/index.jsp" target="_blank">AT&amp;T Park (SF Giants)</a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://houseofair.com" target="_blank">house of air</a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://demo.inspiredcauses.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_2801.jpg"><img alt="IMG_2801" src="http://demo.inspiredcauses.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_2801-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">and the pacific ocean is always free!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style="text-align: center;"><b>what must i pack?</b></h4>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">good walking shoes</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">layers (jacket, scarf, regardless the season)</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">an idea of what you want to see (the city can overwhelm a first timer; know what you want to see)</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">where should we stay?</h3>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">you''ll pay more staying downtown, in the heart of the city, but pay less in transportation that way.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">it''s cheaper to stay down by the airport or in daly city, but you''ll spend time and money transiting in.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">our mission teams often stay at <a href="http://thepickwickhotel.com" target="_blank">the pickwick hotel</a> which is on 5th street between mission and market.</p>', 'san francisco', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '632-revision-8', '', '', '2013-02-09 18:58:06', '2013-02-10 02:58:06', '', 632, 'http://localhost:8888/632-revision-8/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
